                    2012-2013 SOMIBA CONSTITUTION
</center>

<ol type=I>
<li>	ORGANIZATION OF THE LEAGUE
<ol type=A>
<li>The Strat-O-Matic Internet Basketball Association (SOMIBA) consists 
of 24 teams from a pool of all current NBA players.
<li>Each league member should have a reliable Internet e-mail account, 
should check for messages every few days during the season and pre-
season and every day or two near deadlines, and must have the time 
and the desire (and a computer) to create all gameplans for away 
games and play all home games in the scheduled time frames.
<li>In addition to the teams owned by live coaches, the league will 
consist of a number of unowned teams (hereafter referred to as dummy 
teams) which do not actually play games.  Dummy teams simply serve as 
a holding tank for unowned players in the league so that the live 
teams will not be too all-star laden and so that new league members 
will have a reasonable pool of talent from which they may draft new 
teams.
<ol type=1>
<li>The number of dummy teams is determined by subtracting
  the number of owners in the league from 24.
<li>The dummy teams are added to by the commissioner
  during the rookie/free-agent draft and redrafted each year during
  the expansion draft.
<li>Players un-owned either by live owners or dummy teams
  will be  placed in the free-agent pool.
</ol>
<li>Divisions.
<ol type=1>
<li>The league will consist of a number of divisions
determined just prior to the season.
<li>Divisions are purely for organizational purposes and
  do not affect schedules or the playoff bracket.
</ol>
<li>	There are several league officers which as a group form the Executive 
Committee.
<ol type=1>
<li>The duties of the Executive Committee include assisting the 
Commissioner with:
<ol type=a>
		<li>	Supervising all league play in general,
		<li>	Providing final authority on rules interpretation,
		<li>	Conducting the draft,
		<li>	Creating and distributing the schedule,
		<li>	Creating, distributing, and maintaining the rosters,
		<li> Keeping and distributing league statistics and standings, and
		<li> Judging the validity of trades.
</ol>
<li>The Commissioner each year will choose the Executive Committee.
</ol>
<li>Retention of players from year to year:
<ol type=1>
<li>	Live teams that made the playoffs in the previous
  season may retain up to but not more than 10 of their players;
  the cut deadline for this is a few days before the rookie/free-agent
  draft.  This number is 11 for all other teams.
<li>	All players not retained are put into the free-agent
  pool for the subsequent rookie/free-agent draft.
<li>	Each year a week-or-so before the rookie/free-agent
  draft an expansion draft will be held for new league members.  If
  there are no new league members for that year then only dummy teams
  will participate in the expansion draft.
<li>	Only players who played in the NBA the previous year
  are eligible to be drafted in any draft.  Players who did not play
  in the NBA the previous year may, however, be kept on a roster if
  already there.
<li>	There are no free-agent pickups except for the
  rookie/free-agent 
draft unless deemed necessary by the Executive Committee for a 
particular case.  Before the season begins each live team must make 
certain that they have enough players with games and minutes 
available at each position to cover the entire season - the 
Commissioner will assist with the calculation of what's needed and 
will make recommendations as appropriate.  In addition, any trades 
made after the season begins must take into account seasonal games 
and minutes required.  If any coach exceeds or violates minutes 
and/or games limits then he or she will be subject to penalties 
including, but not limited to, reduction of minutes and/or games 
eligible for players the following year.
</ol>
<li>	Each member of the league will choose a city/area and nickname for 
his team.  Coaches are not limited to actual NBA cities or nicknames 
when naming their teams; however, team names must be approved by the 
Commissioner and must be appropriate to good taste.
<li>	Each coach is expected to send gameplans to the Commissioner,
  play games, and send game results to opposing coaches and to the
  Commissioner on or before the schedule times.  There are
  approximately 10 away games and 10 away games in each quarter of the
  season and each quarter lasts approximately 5 weeks.
<li>	If any player violates deadlines repeatedly, the Executive Committee 
may impose additional penalties including expulsion from the league.  
In any case, the Executive Committee will try to do this case-by-case 
in a fair and impartial manner with advice from the league as a 
whole.  Cheating and other unethical activities will not at all be 
tolerated.

<li>	A coach is considered to have failed to fulfill the requirements of 
being in the league if he or she:
<ol type=1>
	<li>	Does not send a legal gameplan by the deadline; or
	<li>	Does not play and send to the Commissioner a home game result by 
the deadline (the only exception to this is if the coach sends before 
the deadline to the Commissioner a home gameplan for the game to be 
autoplayed);
</ol>

<p>	
	Each occurrence of the above counts equally, though if absolutely no-
one, including the Commissioner, is (by their own definition) 
inconvenienced then there is no occurrence.  A coach with "too many" 
occurrences will probably not be invited back into the league the 
following year.  Each case will be handled on an individual basis by 
the Executive Committee, heavily depending upon the pre-occurrence 
communication level of the league member regarding the occurrences in 
question.  The goal here is for zero occurrences to minimize 
inconvenience to the rest of the league.  While it's no fun to take a 
hard line against slightly flaky coaches, it's less fun for the rest 
of us to put up with the trouble of making extra gameplans and 
wondering about the league as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	Of course we all have "real" lives (yuck) which may sometimes 
supersede our league commitments.  Please have the courtesy to 
communicate with the Commissioner regarding any situations which may 
interfere with your league commitments.  Failure to communicate 
beforehand will not be looked on favorably regarding league 
membership in future years.  If something comes up please as soon as 
possible simply e-mail or phone the Commissioner (or better yet the 
entire league) what league commitments you will not be able to 
fulfill and when you will be available for further communication.  
For example, "Hey everyone, I just found out that I'm going out of 
town for a week and won't be able to play games xxxxxxx [list of 
unplayed games] by the coming deadline; I'll be back on 12/16 but 
until then I'll be out of e-mail range."  Situations can be handled 
much more easily if we know about them beforehand with a 
communication like that.
</p>

<p>
	The Commissioner will provide a home phone number
  (650-968-0352) with voice mail at which he can be reached within
  less than a day.  It is the responsibility of the sending coach to
  make sure that the Commissioner receives whatever is needed as the
  Commissioner will respond to all substantive e-mails with "received"
  or "not received" as appropriate.
</p>

<li>	At any time any player may ask for and will receive free and open 
advice from the Commissioner (and most any other league member) on 
any SOMIBA-related issue including how to read this Constitution(!).
</ol>


<li> DRAFT

<ol type=A>
<li>	Expansion draft.
<ol type=1>
<li>When new teams are added to the league before each new season 
(after the new SOM team disk), an expansion draft will be conducted 
by the Commissioner live in an Internet chatroom. 
<li>All of the players in the pool of dummy teams will be
	released to the expansion pool before the expansion draft.
<li>The number of dummy teams will be set at 24 minus the number of 
current live coaches (including all new coaches).
<li>The new live coaches will draft their teams from the above-
mentioned expansion pool.
<li>They will draft against the dummy teams, who will be
	drafted for by the Commissioner or another Executive Committee
	member.
<li>The draft will proceed with live coaches drafting in serpentine 
format and dummies drafting at the end of every round.  For example, 
if there are 4 new teams and 6 dummy teams, the 4 new teams will each 
draft one player, the 6 dummy teams will each draft one player, the 4 
new teams will each draft another player (in reverse order of the 
first round), the dummy teams will each draft another player, and so 
on.
<li>If there is only one new league member then one of the
	dummy teams 
will be considered as a live team (and not as a dummy team) for 
purposes of the expansion draft order.  This dummy team will, 
however, still be drafted by a league official.  In this way the one new 
league member will only have a 50% chance of getting the first pick 
of the expansion draft (the one dummy team may get the first pick).
<li>There will be 10 rounds; each team will draft 10 players.  The 
remaining un-drafted players will go into the rookie/free-agent pool.
</ol>
<li>	Rookie/free-agent draft.
<ol type=1>
<li>	The yearly rookie/free-agent draft will begin on the
	Saturday just before the beginning of the NBA season.  A few
	days before the rookie/free-agent each playoff team will cut
	their roster down to 10 (or fewer) players, and all others 11
	(or fewer), with all cut players eligible in the
	rookie/free-agent draft.
<li>	New and returning league members and each dummy team
	will participate.  Each team will draft a number of players
	necessary to fill their team to somewhere between the roster
	minimum size of 16 and maximum of 18. 
	After the draft there  
will be a brief opportunity to pick up still un-drafted players - 
each coach desiring this option after the draft will send to the 
Commissioner a list of desired players with a list of cuts ("if I get 
player Smith then I'll cut player Johnson") and the Commissioner will 
hold a supplemental draft a day or two after then end of the 
rookie/free-agent draft.
<li>	The draft will be live in an Internet chatroom.
	Coaches who will be unavailable during significant sections of
	the draft should e-mail the Commissioner a list of draft choices.
<li>	The draft order will follow these rules and procedures:
<ol type=a>
	<li>	The order of the top three picks in the first round will be 
determined by lottery, as in the NBA and for the same reasons.  The 
lottery will be executed as follows:
<ol type=i>
	<li>	In the following, the returning coach with the worst record 
from the previous year is labeled W.  The returning coach with 
the 2nd to worst record is labeled 2W.  The returning coach with 
the 3rd to worst record is labeled 3W.  A returning coach who 
made the playoffs last year may not participate in this lottery.  
This lottery which may be performed any time after the end of 
the previous regular season does not become official until the 
pre-season before the draft when coaches have made a declaration 
that they will be returning.
	<li>	The Commissioner will use a random method to determine
	the draft order.  There will be six equally likely
	possibilities, shown in the grid below:<br>
	(1)	W, 2W, 3W<br>
	(2)	W, 2W, 3W<br>
	(3)	W, 3W, 2W<br>
	(4)	2W, W, 3W<br>
	(5)	2W, 3W, W<br>
	(6)	3W, W, 2W<br> 
</ol>
	<li>	Tie-breakers for draft picks will be determined randomly.  
However, if a tie-breaker was used for playoff positioning then 
that same tie-breaker result will apply for draft choice 
positioning - in other words, the team determined by tie-breaker to 
be a higher seed will get the lower draft pick in the first round.  
Teams with the same record will alternate drafting position in 
even-numbered rounds.
	<li>	New league members will be placed in the draft order after the 
teams that did not make the playoffs and before the teams that made 
the playoffs, in reverse order of the way they drafted in the first 
round of the expansion draft.  This order will be reversed each round.
	<li>	The SOMIBA champion from the previous year will draft
	last while the SOMIBA runner-up will draft second-to-last of
	returning teams.
	<li>	Dummy team picks will be placed in each round between
	the picks of new teams and the picks of playoff teams, in
	reverse order of the way they drafted in the first round of
	the expansion draft.  Their order will be reversed each round.
	<li>  There may be cases where a coach owns the draft pick of a
	team from last year which is not returning in the current
	year, in this case the draft pick is placed as if that team
	were returning (so that the round with that draft pick in it
	will have one more "team" for the purposes of the chart
	below); similarly, there may be rounds where there are fewer
	"teams" than teams in the league.
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>


<li> ROSTERS
<ol type=A>
<li>	For any one game, teams must have no more than 12 players set as 
eligible.
<li>	Injuries will not be used, though a player is limited to his
  actual number of NBA minutes (adjusted by 10% upward for players
  with 750+ minutes and 5% for others) and games played during 
the season.  See the roster file for eligible player games and 
minutes.  If the Executive Committee has further limited a player's 
games or minutes this will be indicated on the roster file.
<li>	Trading:
<ol type=1>
<li>	Trading is allowed with the following restrictions:
<ol type=a>
	<li>	All coaches involved in a trade must send an e-mail to
	  the Commissioner stating the exact terms of the trade, with
	  no conditions withheld or secret.
	<li>	New coaches in their first season of participation
	  with their own team may not trade the player taken in the
	  1st round of the expansion draft nor may they trade the next
	  season's 1st round rookie/free-agent draft pick.
	<li>	When considering a trade proposal it is in each
	  coach's best interests to seek advice from other league
	  members regarding the deal.  A coach who fails to do this is
	  more-likely-than-not doing his team and possibly the league
	  a disservice.
	<li>	Trades may only consist of exact and spelled-out
	  combinations of players and draft choices.  No money or
	  unspecified exchanges for trade value may take place.  Only
	  draft choices of the next occurring rookie/free-agent draft
	  are eligible to be traded.
	<li>	Trades will be reviewed as detailed later in this Constitution.
	<li>	Trading may only occur between the official announced
	  beginning of the pre-season and a few days before the
	  beginning of the regular season AND during the two-or-so
	  days of each of the season's first two session breaks.  No
	  pre-season trade becomes official until all parties involved
	  in the trade are committed to playing in the league for the
	  current season.  Trades may be "agreed to" at any other
	  time; however, if one of the players in a trade suffers a
	  serious injury (for example) before the trade is allowed to
	  be made or if a player's card is not nearly as good as it
	  was expected to be it is unreasonable to believe that the
	  coach receiving that player will still want to make the
	  trade.
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>


<li>  PLAY
<ol type=A>
<li>	Logistics:
<ol type=1>
<li>A league timetable of due dates and deadlines will be provided by 
the Commissioner.
<ol type=a>
	<li>	The regular season will consist of 82 games, 41 at home and 41 
away and will be split into 4 sessions with approximately 10 home 
and 10 away games per session.
	<li>	Each session will last approximately five or six weeks.
	<li>	For each game the home coach will either receive from the away 
coach a gameplan for the game or the game will be played face-to-
face if desired by both coaches.  After a coach has finished 
creating each away gameplan for a particular quarter of the season 
that coach should then zip up those gameplans into one file and e-
mail that file to the Commissioner before the gameplan deadline.  The
	Commissioner will then post this to the league website.
  If a coach has not 
received a particular gameplan for a home game then that coach may 
e-mail the Commissioner requesting the gameplan; if the 
Commmissioner has not received that gameplan then he will e-mail 
the away team requesting that gameplan and if still not received 
after another day or two the Commissioner will create a gameplan 
for the away coach and send it to the home coach; the away coach 
will receive at least a warning for not sending gameplans in time 
and not responding to the Commissioner's reminder e-mail.
	<li>	The deadlines for sending away gameplans will be approximately 
three weeks before the deadline for sending home game results to 
the Commissioner.  If the game is scheduled for face-to-face but 
the coaches end up not getting together for the game it is the 
responsibility of the away coach to make sure the home coach and 
the Commissioner receive a gameplan in time for the game to be 
played and also the responsibility of the home coach to make sure 
the game is played.  If the home coach does end up sending to the 
Commissioner the game result file before the deadline and no-one is 
(by their own definition) inconvenienced then there is no 
occurrence of a problem.
</ol>
<li>	Approximately three days before each game result deadline the 
Commissioner will e-mail the entire league with a list of game 
results he has not yet received.  If the game result (including gfl 
and prt file) is not received by the game result deadline then at the 
Commissioner's next opportunity if the game result is still not 
received the Commissioner will use the away gameplan he has already 
received for that game and he will autoplay the game using a "default 
gameplan" (created by setting the eligible players, setting all 
defensive coach profiles to zero, and letting the computer suggest 
the lineup) for coaches who have not sent to him a gameplan for that 
game.  Please play games on time -- it's enough effort being 
Commissioner without having to set up extra gameplans and autoplay 
extra games.
<li>	The playoffs:
<ol type=a>
	<li>	The playoffs consists of half of the teams in the
	league, as long as they finished with 42 or more wins and are
	not unowned. 
	<li>	The teams with the best records will make the playoffs 
regardless of division.
	<li>	In the playoff seeding charts below, the team with the best 
record will be "1," the team with the second best record will be 
"2," and so on.
	<li>	A tie for the final playoff spot will be resolved by a one-game 
playoff with the following tie-breakers determining the home team:
<ol type=i>
	<li>	Head-to-head winning percentage.
	<li>	Coin toss.
</ol>
	<li>	No team will be excluded from making the playoffs and no	team 
will be assured of making the playoffs due to a tie-breaker 
involving no additional game(s).  If multiple pre-playoff rounds 
are needed to resolve three or more teams:  if there is one playoff 
spot available then team 3 will play team 2 with the winner playing 
team 1 and the winner of that taking the spot; if there are two 
playoff spots available then team 1 will play team 2 with the loser 
playing team 3 and the loser of that missing out on the playoffs; 
if there are four teams then a single-elimination-type tourney will 
be held.  There will be no games played limits in pre-playoff 
games.
	<li>	Playoff matchups are determined as follows:
<ol type=i>
	<li>	For four teams:  1 plays 4 and 2 plays 3
	<li>	For five teams:  4 plays 5, in the second round 1 plays the 
winner of 4 and 5 while 2 plays 3
	<li>	For six teams:  3 plays 6 and 4 plays 5, in the second round 
1 plays the lower-ranked winner while 2 plays the higher-
ranked winner
	<li>	For seven  teams:  2 plays 7, 3 plays 6, and 4 plays 5; in 
the second round 1 plays the lowest-ranked winner
	<li>	For eight teams:  1 plays 8, 2 plays 7, 3 plays 6, and 4 
plays 5; in the second round the highest-ranked team remaining 
plays the lowest-ranked team remaining
	<li>	For nine teams:  8 plays 9, in the second round 1 plays the 
winner of 8 and 9; otherwise, same as for eight teams
	<li>	For ten teams:  7 plays 10 and 8 plays 9, in the second 
round 1 plays the lower-ranked winner in round one while 2 
plays the higher-ranked winner in round one; otherwise, same 
as for eight teams
</ol>
	<li>	Ties for playoff seeding will be broken as follows:
<ol type=i>
				<li>	Head-to-head winning percentage.
				<li>	Coin toss.
</ol>
	<li>	All rounds will consist of best-of-seven-game series.
	<li>	All playoff rounds are single elimination.
	<li>	Before each playoff round each participant must choose 12 
players to be on the eligible roster for the entirety of that 
playoff round.
	<li>	The higher seeded team gets Home Field Advantage in
	games 1,  2, and 5 in a five-game series and in games 1, 2, 5,
	and 7 in a seven-game series except in the Finals.  In the
	Finals the higher seeded team gets Home Field Advantage in
	games 1, 2, 6, and 7.  All games use the "Neutral Court"
	setting.
	<li>	The playoffs will take place as stated in the league timetable 
sent out by the Commissioner at the end of the regular season.
</ol>
</ol>

<li>	Player usage
<ol type=1>
<li>	Players must be rated by SOM (that is, given minutes
	in the fatigue grid) in the appropriate NBA league file at a
	given position in order to play at that position.  Eligibility
	will be listed on the league roster. 
<li>	If a player is rated at a position, even if given only one minute 
there, he may play that position as much as a coach wishes him to 
within the constraints of his playing time limitations (see below).  
The Commissioner will provide a league roster with all of the 
eligible positions and total allowed fatigue grid minutes per game 
for each player as well as the games and minutes allowed for each 
player during the season.
<li>	Point guards may not play shooting guard unless rated to do so on 
the roster.
<li>	Shooting guards may not play point guard unless rated to do so on 
the roster.
<li>	Players will be limited to the number of games that they played in 
the NBA regular season.
<li>	The games which a player must miss will be determined by the coach 
before the Commissioner distributes the actual SOMIBA schedule.
<ol type=a>
	<li>	Coaches will map out which players will miss which games (by 
game number, 1-82), making sure that all other constraints (fatigue 
grid rules, for example) can be satisfied in each game.  Coaches 
should try hard to schedule their players to miss consecutive games 
so that it is much easier to play games during the season.
	<li>	Coaches will then send this list to the Commissioner who will 
review for each coach the validity of the list.  The Commissioner will
have a member of the Executive Committee review his list.
	<li>	After randomly creating the schedule of games the Commissioner 
will convert each team's games missed list to day numbers and send 
the full list to the league and the web page rosters.
	<li>	If a coach accidentally uses a player in a game for which that 
player was scheduled to miss then the Commissioner should be 
notified immediately to determine a course of action (usually 
simply rescheduling the missed game later in the season against the 
same opponent).
</ol>
<li>	Players will be limited in SOMIBA season playing time to their 
total number of NBA regular season minutes plus 10% for players with
750+ minutes and 5% for others.  If a coach 
accidentally overuses a player then that player must miss playoff 
time on a two-for-one basis in the following way:  if a player 
averaged 24 minutes per NBA game and was overused in our regular 
season by 18 minutes then he must miss the first playoff game and may 
only play 12 minutes in an additional playoff game (this is in 
addition to games missed from rule 8 below) for a total of 36 minutes 
(which is 18 doubled); if a player is used in more regular season 
games than allowed, then that player must miss two playoff games per 
regular season game overused (missing at least the first two playoff 
games).  Purposeful overuse of players will not be tolerated and further
penalties will be imposed including being kicked out of the league.  If
a coach overuses a player and that coach's team does not make the playoffs 
then penalties will be imposed for the following year's regular season.
<li>	Any player who played less than 16 games or less than
	100 minutes in the previous NBA season is not eligible to play
	in the playoffs, with the exception that a player who played
	more than 300 minutes in the previous NBA season is eligible.
Eligible Players are not limited in playing time (but are 
still limited in the fatigue grid as described below) except in the 
number of games they may play based upon the following chart:  if a 
player is eligible to play 1-14 regular season games then he may play 
in 1 game per playoff series, if a player is eligible to play 15-29 
regular season games then he may play in 2 games per playoff series, 
if a player is eligible to play in 30-40 regular season games then he 
may play in 3 games per playoff series, while a player who is 
eligible to play in 41 or more regular season games is not limited in 
this manner.
<li>	Setting the fatigue grid:  the "fatigue grid" is the grid in the 
computer manager with boxes for minutes listed at each position for each 
player.  [Contrast with the "lineup grid" which is the grid with the 
2 minute periods listed for each position during the game.]
<ol type=a>
	<li>	Coaches must have at least 2 players with non-zero minutes 
assigned in the fatigue grid per position for each game.  Players 
scheduled to miss the game must be set as ineligible and may not 
count towards this 2-player limit.
	<li>	A player must be assigned in the fatigue grid a number of 
minutes equal to or less than the minutes per game listed for him 
on the league roster.  For example, a player rated on the roster at 
PG and SG for a total of 35 minutes per game may be assigned 4 
minutes at PG and 31 minutes at SG in the fatigue grid.  Since we 
use the "static" fatigue system there is really no need to modify 
the fatigue grid at all (except for the computer coach to determine 
fatigue and foul-trouble replacements in road games).
</ol>
<li>	Maximum number of minutes a player can play in a game:
<ol type=a>
	<li>	Though a player is not limited in the minutes he may play in any 
particular game, the fatigue grid rules above present various 
limits for each player.
	<li>	A player may not be given minutes in any grid nor play at a 
position where he does not have minutes allocated on the league 
roster (in other words, Sabonis is never allowed to play guard!).
</ol>
</ol>

<li>	Additional game rules:
<ol type=1>
<li>	All play will be done on the computer.  No board gaming with dice 
is allowed.
<li>	A player may only guard an opposing position (through the use of 
the "assign" button) if the defender is rated to play that position 
(Sabonis is never allowed to defend a guard!).  Exception:  a player 
currently playing point guard may defend the opposing shooting guard 
and a player currently playing shooting guard may defend the opposing 
point guard.  For example, a player playing SF rated by SOM at 
SG/SF/PF may defend against the opposing PF (as long as all other 
defensive matchups are also legal) but may not defend against the 
opposing PG.
<li>	Face-to-face.  Follow this sequence of events for setting strategy.  
In each of the steps below, the visiting team makes its move first, 
followed by the home team.
<ol type=a>
	<li>	Select lineups.
	<li>	Position offensive players (either inside or outside).
	<li>	Set defensive match-ups.
	<li>	Set defensive double-teaming.

</ol>
<li> If a league member accidentally violates a rule during a game (for 
example, accidentally setting his team for "home court advantage" 
for his home team LOS against team NYO) then he must inform the 
Commissioner who will have the Executive Committee impose a fair 
penalty (for example, when NYO is next the home team against LOS 
"home court advantage" should be used).

<li>	Setting up computer coach profiles and gameplans:
<ol type=1>
<li>	Select the league file and your team.
<li>	Set Defensive Profile.  You should select the specific
	opponent you are to be playing on this road game because this
	defensive profile will be included in the gameplan sent to him
	and will be imported into his system.  Note that players whose
	shooting tendencies are	rated **** and who are not completely
	blank on 3-point attempts will have their set defensive
	profile set to 2 (normal defense) by default when the league
	file is created, this may be changed by any coach who uses set
	defensive profile so is just a default.
<ol type=a>
	<li>	Select your opponent for the game.
	<li>	Follow the instructions on the screen and in the manual for 
these settings.  Contact the Commissioner or another league member 
for assistance if desired.
</ol>
<li>	Select Computer Manager.
<ol type=a>
	<li>	Select Eligible Players and choose up to 12 players to
	make eligible.
	<li>	Edit your Gameplan -- the Player Profiles screen:
<ol type=i>
	<li>	GP = Actual games played.  You may not change this number.
	<li>	GS and INPCT.  These numbers are mostly irrelevant to our 
league.  However, you may not modify the INPCT from 0 or 100 - a 
player with INPCT=0 may not play inside and a player with INPCT=100 
may not play outside on offense.
	<li>	STLSHT = The Steal Shoot percentage which tells the computer 
coach how often this player is to take a fastbreak shot off a steal 
rating.
	<li>	BLK = This number is irrelevant to our league except that YOU 
MUST ENTERn ZERO BLK MINUTES FOR A PLAYER WHO HAS ZERO MINUTES 
ASSIGNED IN THE FATIGUE GRID or else the game will not run at all 
(this is a bug in the sombk program).
	<li>	PG, SG, SF, PF, C = These fields list the fatigue minutes to be 
played at each position. A player may not be gridded at a position 
for which he is not rated on the league roster. In each game at 
least 2 PLAYERS MUST BE ASSIGNED FATIGUE GRID MINUTES AT EACH 
POSITION.  There is little reason to modify these numbers now that 
we use the "static" fatigue system.
	<li>	For the remaining fields on this screen, refer to the SOM manual 
or ask the Commissioner for assistance.
</ol>
	<li>	Edit your Gameplan -- the Computer Coach Instructions screen:  you may set the 
lineup grid however you like with the restriction that a player may 
not be gridded at a position for which he is not rated on the league 
roster.  For example, a player listed on the league roster at 
SG/SF/PF may never play or be gridded to play PG or C though he may 
be lineup gridded to play any amount of time at any of his eligible 
positions.  Keep in mind that any player gridded for more than 12 
consecutive minutes in any half will probably fatigue and be replaced 
by the computer coach during that time.
</ol>
<li>	Exporting a gameplan file to another coach:
<ol type=a>
	<li>	First, determine what day on the schedule the game is to be 
played:
<ol type=i>
	<li>	Select the appropriate league.
	<li>	From the Main Menu select Game, New Scheduled.
	<li>	Page ahead using N for next day until you come to the game in 
question.  If you look at the top of the listing of games for 
that day it gives the schedule-related day number.
	<li>	Write this number down.
</ol>
	<li>	Select  your team.
	<li>	See above for instructions on creating the defensive profile and 
your gameplan.  Make certain that you set as "ineligible" those 
players who are scheduled to miss the game - this is the easiest 
thing to make a mistake on and it's a pain in the butt for everyone 
(including the Commissioner) to correct this mistake - so DOUBLE-
CHECK your gameplan versus the days missed list on the roster.
	<li>	Once you have set the defensive profile and the gameplan as you 
want (within league rules), from the screen with the lineup grid 
choose Export Gameplan.
	<li>	When prompted for a filename, name the file according to these 
conventions:
<ol type=i>
	<li>	filename = AAAHHHnn
	<li>	AAA represents the 3 character symbol for the away team
	<li>	HHH represents the 3 character symbol for the home team
	<li>	nn represents the two digit number for the day on the schedule 
(see a above).  For example, if you are team LOS, the team you 
are sending the gameplan to is NYO, and the game is scheduled 
for day 34 then type LOSNYO34.
</ol>
	<li>	Save the gameplan.
	<li>	After you have created all your gameplans for the current 
quarter of the season, zip them up into one single file, and send 
that file to the Commissioner.
</ol>
<li>	Importing gameplan files from other coaches:
<ol type=a>
	<li>	Download gameplans from the league website.
	<li>	Go into the SOM Basketball game.
<ol type=i>
	<li>	Select the appropriate league.
	<li>	From the Main Menu select Game, New Scheduled.
	<li>	Find the game in question, using page ahead or jump.
	<li>	Change the game from Hold to Manual.
	<li>	Start the game.
	<li>	From the Lineup screen of the opposing team, choose Import 
gameplan.
	<li>	The appropriate gameplan file will be named with the
	convention AAAHHHnn.GPL (with AAA, HHH, and nn defined previously).
	<li>	Select the appropriate gameplan file.  It will be imported 
into your system.
	<li> Click on Continue to begin the game. If once you get to the 
	  first strategy screen just before the game begins you notice 
	  that the opposing coach has set a player who was scheduled to 
	  miss the game as "eligible" then quit the game (right-click the 
	  mouse at this point to abort the beginning of the game) and ask 
	  the coach to send to you a legal gameplan - also notify the 
	  Commissioner of the error in the gameplan
</ol>
</ol>
<li> Special Rules
<ol type=a>
	<li> You may only play the press defense when you are not ahead
	by 10 or more points in the game (if you are ahead by 10 and
	still pressing then you must press F1 and call timeout to stop
	the press defense) and you may not play press defense for more
	than 12 minutes in any one game.
	<li> Whenever one team is being controlled by the computer
	(typically the visiting team) the other team must have at
	least one PF or C positioned inside on offense at all times;
	this does not apply to games played live via Netplay; this
	rule will likely be removed if in a future version Strat fixes
	the computer gameplan to allow the defense to keep its inside
	block defender back to provide block support against an
	outside player.
	<li> If there is an unplayed home game on a coach’s schedule
	then that coach may not play a part of or a full practice game
	against that team using that team’s gameplan for that game;
	for example, if team WAL has an unplayed home game on the
	schedule against SUN then WAL may not import SUN’s gameplan
	designed for that game and play a part of or a full practice
	game against SUN’s gameplan.
</ol>

<li>		Exporting game results to the opposing coach and to the 
Commissioner:
<ol type=a>
	<li>	Obtain the game file will be stored in
	C:\SOMBKW\EXPORT\20XXXXI, where 20XXXXI is the league name.
	<li>	Obtain the boxscore from C:\SOMBKW\PRINT\20XXXXI.
	<li>	Create a zip file of the appropriate name (for
	example, LOSNYO34.ZIP) which contains both of these files (and
	optionally the summary and pbp files), and send this zip file
	to the Commissioner and to your opponent.
</ol>
<li>	Importing game results from opposing coach after an away game 
(while is step is not really necessary since the Commissioner keeps 
official records of game results, it may help you stay within minutes 
limits of your players):
<ol type=a>
	<li>	When you receive the e-mail message that has the opposing team's 
game result files attached to it, save the attached file (it should 
have a name with the format AAAHHHnn.ZIP).
	<li>	Unzip the file and move the gamefile to the C:\SOMBKW\IMPORT directory.
	<li>	Go into the SOM Basketball game:
<ol type=i>
	<li>	Select the appropriate league.
	<li>	From the Main Menu select Statistics and Import Game Results.
	<li>	Select the appropriate game file (with the extension .GFL)
	<li>	The game result will be imported into your system.
</ol>
	<li>	At the end of each session of the season the Commissioner will 
send to each coach a league update containing game results for all 
games to date.  In addition, the Commissioner will keep the web 
page up-to-date with current stats and game results.
	<li>	The Commissioner will will always wait at least 24
  hours before importing a result and will not accept results which do
  not include the prt and gfl file and which are sent both to the
  Commissioner and to the visiting coach within the same e-mail. If
  you would like to protest any result then that should be done via
  e-mail less than 24 hours after the initial result is received or
  else the game result will be imported and the protest will likely
  not be upheld (or if it is then it will not result in a game
  replay).
</ol>
</ol>

<li>	Known bugs in the SOM computer basketball game:
<ol type=1>
<li>	If any player's gameplan fatigue grid minutes are set to zero and 
you click on Set Eligible Players from within the pre-league-game 
Lineup screen, you receive a "floating point, divide by zero" error 
message and are kicked out to DOS.  The solution is just don't do 
this.  You may instead look at your team's eligible players in the 
Program Computer Coach section (editing your gameplan) and determine 
the visiting team's eligible players once the game has started by 
looking at the players listed on bench.  If once you get to the first 
strategy screen just before the game begins you notice that the 
opposing coach has set a player scheduled to miss the game as 
eligible then quit the game (right-click the mouse at this point to 
abort the beginning of the game) and ask the coach to send to you a 
legal gameplan - also notify the Commissioner of the error in the 
gameplan.
<li>	If a player is assigned more than zero BLK minutes within the 
fatigue grid but is assigned zero playing minutes at all positions in 
the fatigue grid then when you try to begin the game/jumpball you 
will receive a "floating point, divide by zero" error message and be 
kicked out to DOS.  The solution is to assign a player with zero 
fatigue grid minutes zero BLK minutes.

1999-2000 Constitution Addendum - League Rulings and Executive
Committee
</p>

<p>
The Executive Committee this year consists of veteran league members.
There will always be at least 3 league 
officers involved in every non-obvious ruling; the Commissioner will 
make a decision on what is "obvious" such as those cases explicitly and 
exactly covered in the Constitution.  The Commissioner will attempt to 
err on the side of calling for league officer votes rather than make a 
league ruling on the spot.  In some rare cases (mostly huge issues 
and/or issues where time is not a major factor) the Commissioner may 
call for a league-wide vote which will follow the same rules as league 
officer votes.
</p>

<p>
During league rulings any league business directly depending upon the 
result of a ruling will be halted until the ruling is rendered.  All 
rulings in process and those already decided will be posted on the web 
page as time permits.  No secret ballots are allowed and each vote will 
be listed with a name beside it.  The Commissioner will perform and 
count all votes even for votes in which he is not participating.
</p>

<p>
League officers will listen to any and all discussions by any league 
member on the subject of an upcoming ruling and of course discussion may 
and often should occur but at no point will a league officer say to 
someone anything to the effect of "my vote is completely dependent upon 
your opinion" as this puts too much pressure on the person giving the 
opinion, especially if that person is not a league officer and/or is 
directly involved in the situation the league is ruling upon.  It is not 
at all up to the "injured" party to ask for a league ruling (though of 
course anyone may discuss what they want); rather, it is up to the 
league officers to maintain the integrity of the league by ruling on all 
league situations whether or not someone feels "injured."  For example, 
if coach A overuses player Smith against coach B a league ruling will be 
made regardless of whether or not coach B cares (though coach B's input 
is desired as is the input of everyone involved).
</p>

<p>
All league rulings will take no longer than three days (hopefully less) 
from the time it is brought to the Commissioner's attention except under 
extraordinary circumstances or during few-day-pre-announced periods of 
time when the Commissioner is not available.  In any case where a league 
ruling is needed each league officer will be given a choice of rulings 
and will also be free to submit their own ruling.  The Commissioner will 
lay down general guidelines of each ruling as situations come up (for 
example, "this ruling it seems may take longer than three days as 
additional discussion seems to be necessary") though the Commissioner 
may modify the guidelines of a specific ruling if the situation 
warrants.  If the Commissioner has been disqualified from a league 
ruling then another league officer involved in the ruling 
process may if the issue is big enough in his opinion call for a league-
wide vote on the issue with a four-day time limit.
</p>

<p>
If a league officer's team is directly involved in the outcome of a 
ruling then that league officer will not rule on that ruling.  An 
example of this is when one or more of the reasonable choices for the 
ruling will potentially directly benefit or disadvantage that league 
officer's team.  The Commissioner will determine which league officers 
are ineligible for each league ruling.  If the Commissioner does not 
disqualify himself from a league ruling then any league officer may call 
for a vote of league officers (not including the Commissioner or any 
league officer already disqualified by the Commissioner) on whether or 
not the Commissioner may vote on that specific league ruling; this vote 
will as with most other votes take no longer than two days, if by that 
time not enough votes are cast (see below for criteria, basically 3 
votes are needed) then the Commissioner may vote on that specific
issue.
</p>

<p>
If a league officer feels that the Commissioner ruled a decision as 
"obvious" (and therefore the Commissioner made the decision without a 
league officer vote) then any league officer may call for a vote of all 
other league officers (not including the Commissioner) to decide whether 
the ruling made by the Commissioner should stand.  The normal three-day 
timeframe for this vote is in effect but if the vote takes longer than 
that then that is acceptable.  However, unlike all other votes league 
business will not be halted during this vote.  If the vote in this case 
is to rule the issue as "non-obvious" and therefore the issue should 
have been put up to a league officer vote then league business which 
directly depends upon the ruling will halt at that time and the process 
of ruling on the issue will start over.  If business already depending 
upon the ruling has already taken place then the league officers will be 
voting on what to do taking that into consideration.
</p>

<p>
Trade Approval:
</p>

<p>
All trades involving new league members &#150; that is, league members who 
have not played through at least one full season -- go through a league 
approval process based upon the "questionable trades" section below 
before they become official.  Trades will go through the same voting 
process as league rulings with the following choices:  A) The trade is 
approved or B) The trade is denied as stated though the trade may be 
reworked.
</p>

<p>
All trades not involving new league members become official when they 
are acknowledged by the Commissioner as received from all involved 
coaches.  The Commissioner will notify the Executive Committee of all 
trades and any member of the Executive Committee may call for a vote of 
the Executive Committee as outlined above for trades involving new 
league members at which time the trade is no longer official and is put 
on hold pending the outcome of the vote.
</p>

Examples of questionable trades:
a)A coach knowing or even suspecting that he is in his last year in the 
league trades away an inordinate amount of future value (young players 
and/or draft picks) in a trade for present value veteran players;
b)	A coach who becomes disenchanted with the league and no longer takes 
it seriously makes an imbalanced trade;
c)	A coach who takes advantage of a new player by ripping him off in a 
trade, the ripoff may even be slight and intentional and yet still be a 
deal which disadvantages the team of the new player;
d)	Any trade in which one team involved in the trade benefits much more 
than another team involved in the trade due to the second team hurting 
his own team intentionally or unintentionally.
The above examples are not all-inclusive; other possibilities exist.  It 
is left to the judgment of the Executive Committee to determine what is 
questionable and when to call for a vote.  When in doubt the Executive 
Committee should tend to play it safe and call for a vote.  It is 
probably the most important duty of members of the Executive Committee 
to avoid the situation in which a team gains success by making trades 
which at the time fairly clearly disadvantage other teams as the league 
becomes a lot less fun when teams get stronger due to unfair trades.


<p>
League Ruling Guidelines:
</p>

<p>
The following are only guidelines but they should be used where they 
apply.  In extraordinary cases the Commissioner may override any league 
ruling &#150;- and bear the responsibility of such a decision &#150;-
if a vote on a huge issue takes the league in an inappropriate
direction.  Examples of this are if league guidelines are clearly not
being followed or if other non-desired elements are added into the
league (including but not limited to the inclusion of salary caps or
real money into the league).  Ultimately the Commissioner who is
responsible for the large bulk of administrative work in the league
must be comfortable with the league for which he is the Commissioner.
</p>

<p>
Other than the specific written guidelines here fairness should be the 
goal in any league ruling (and hopefully fairness guides are included 
below), fairness to those involved in the decision and fairness to the 
league as a whole.  If a league member violates a rule is the penalty to 
that league member fair considering the offense and the advantage given 
to the "injured" party fair?  If the league member pointed out their own 
unintentional mistake then that should reflect favorably in cases not 
explicitly covered below especially if the mistake would not likely have 
been noticed otherwise.
</p>

<p>
If a league member intentionally commits an offense due to not taking a 
particular rule seriously then in general a ruling should double the 
severity of the penalty or triple it if the coach does not regret the 
error.  If a league member intentionally commits an offense for the 
probable purpose of making the team's or a player's record or stats 
better or worse then this cheating is clear grounds for expulsion of the 
league member (for stats doctoring perhaps removal of some player 
eligibility for the playoffs or next season while for cheating to win or 
lose a game perhaps league expulsion is appropriate).  In any case the 
"injured" coach should not gain extra advantage other than to make up 
for the original offense; any further penalty (for example, a punitive 
penalty) should benefit the league overall or else random teams (as 
decided by the specific league ruling).
</p>

<p>
If a league member is not able to play games or send gameplans for a 
period of time then it is acceptable for that league member to pre-send 
to the Commissioner gameplans both for away games and for home games; 
these home games will be autoplayed.  This applies also to the playoffs.  
However, this sort of thing and especially repeat occurrences is not 
what the league is about -&#150; autoplays are not a fun part of the league 
though they may be necessary sometimes in emergencies.
</p>

<p>
If a coach has doubts that he will be able to fulfill his league 
obligations for the current season but will sincerely probably be able 
to in the following season (and this is to be voted on by the Executive 
Committee whether it appears to be true) then that coach may keep his 
team although not play in the current season.  In this case no trades 
are allowed with that team for the year(s) in which the team is not 
playing games, the team must field at least 164 games and 4000 minutes 
per position and 20000 minutes overall as all other teams must (and if 
necessary a league-officers-constructed swap may be made between the 
team and the remaining expansion pool to fulfill these requirements), 
and in the rookie/free-agent draft of the season following a season in 
which games are not played the draft position of the team will fall 
third-to-last of all returning teams.  If a coach has traded during the 
pre-season but later decides that he does not have enough time to play 
games that season then those trades will be further reviewed and while 
they may not be overturned league officers may impose penalties of 
removing or decreasing draft choices if they determine that the trade 
was made knowing the potential for not being able to play in the league.  
For example, if during the pre-season coach A trades away good very old 
player Johnson for a young player or a draft choice and then later coach 
A decides not to play games that season and if the league officers 
decide that coach A made the trade in part because he may not be playing 
games that season then the league officers may decide to lower coach A's 
first-round rookie/free-agent draft choice (in the next rookie/free-
agent draft) 8 spots of returning coaches.
</p>

<p>
In general it is acceptable for someone who is not in the league to take 
over a team if requested to do so by a coach unable to play games or by 
the Commissioner for filling the place of a coach who left the league in 
mid-season.  In this case the replacement coach will not be able to keep 
the team the following season but may join the league via the expansion 
draft as any other new league member.  
</p>

<p>
If a team was run by a human for at least 2/4 of the season and was
run by a human for the final 1/4 of the season and that human would be
running the team in the playoffs then if that team qualifies for the
playoffs that most recent human would run the team in the playoffs; If
a team qualifies for the playoffs but does not fit the above then that
team would be disqualified from playoff participation and there would
be one fewer team in the playoffs.
</p>

<p>
If a league member leaves the league then his team is thrown into the 
Expansion Pool.  However, if there are X such teams being thrown into 
the pool and there are exactly X league members wanting to join the 
league for that year and those new league members specifically request 
to take over the teams being thrown in (and if X &gt; 1 then all of the new 
league members must agree to which team they request) then this may be 
acceptable &#150;- this issue would be put up to an Executive Committee vote 
if it happens.  It is unfair for 2 people to be joining the league and 
for 1 of them to take over an existing team while the other draft from 
the Expansion Pool even if this is desired by all parties.
</p>

<p>
It is generally not acceptable for a coach to throw in his team for a 
new team to be drafted from the Expansion Pool as if a new coach. 
However, if it is clear that the coach did not inordinately weaken his 
current team's future by inordinately strengthening its past then the 
Executive Committee will consider the request if unusual circumstances 
have occurred.  For example, if a coach's team has had bad luck with 
regard to player choices with good players being seriously injured 
and/or promising young players turning out to be bad then the Executive 
Committee may allow a coach requesting it to throw in his team for a new 
expansion-drafted team.
</p>

<p>
In the regular season there will be no game replays as this puts too 
much of an operational burden on the Commissioner once the game has been 
imported and is in general contrary to the philosophy of the league.  
The Commissioner may make a very rare exception to this if he feels that 
it is warranted (and the Commissioner almost never feels that it is) and 
in that case may include a game replay as an option on the ballot for 
the Executive Committee vote.  The only example which comes to mind in 
which a replay in the regular season might be appropriate is if a coach 
A intentionally cheats in a game he wins (coach A would probably be 
expelled from the league at this point), this game knocks coach B out of 
playoff contention, and the Commissioner has not yet imported the game 
result.
</p>

<p>
Playoff Rulings:
</p>

<p>
During the playoffs replays may be done under certain circumstances.  No 
replays will be done without a vote of the league officers.
</p>

<p>
If any player is used in any game for any number of minutes over allowed 
and that team wins the game then the game will be replayed and any games 
which have been played after that still count; the Commissioner is 
responsible for noticing any overuses.  The only exception to this is if 
somehow the road team's player was overused due to an error by the home 
team's coach in which case the result will stand; the Commissioner will 
review the away team's gameplan and if he or any of the league officers 
feel that the home coach has made an error then the league officers will 
vote on whether or not the game needs to be replayed.
</p>

<p>
Simply put, if the winning coach made any error causing any material 
benefit or overuse of any player then the game will be replayed.  For 
example, setting "home court advantage" when not supposed to will cause 
that game to be replayed if the home team won the game.  The league 
officers will determine what is "material" but it should use the 
broadest criteria in determining this &#150;- only errors causing no change 
in game winning possibilities whatsoever for either team should 
eliminate the need for a replay.
</p>

<p>
If a league officer makes an error which benefits (as decided by the 
league officers) a team which ended up winning the game then that game 
should be replayed.  If the league officer's error did not benefit the 
winning team in any way whatsoever then the game result should stand.  
It is realized thus that if a league officer makes an error which 
benefits team A then that puts team A at a disadvantage since a win in 
that game only means a replay but a loss means a loss but as long as the 
error was inadvertent then "those are the breaks".  League officers (and 
everyone) should try very hard not to make errors.
</p>

<p>
If a player is overused for any minutes in a game in which that player's 
coach lost (and the player's coach caused the error) then beginning with 
the next game it will be treated as if the player were overused in the 
regular season &#150;- see those guidelines (i.e., has to miss double the 
games or minutes of the overuse in the next games).  If an error other 
than player overuse is made by a losing coach then no penalties will be 
assessed as long as that error does not affect any other game(s).
</p>

<p>
If an error is not noticed once the next round of the playoffs has begun 
(which is announced by the Commissioner at least two days after the end 
of the previous round) then no replays will be done for that error, 
though games/minutes penalties will be assessed (whether or not the game 
was won or lost) from the time the error was noticed.  If the next round 
of the playoffs has not begun then replays will occur as outlined above, 
though any errors should be brought to the Commissioner's attention 
immediately.
</p>

<p>
If any error is made which is determined by league officers to probably 
be on purpose then additional penalties will be imposed by the Executive 
Committee.  If the intentional error is made for the probable purpose of 
making the team's or a player's record or stats better or worse then 
that is considered cheating and will be dealt with very harshly up to 
and including immediate expulsion from the league.  If the intentional 
error is made for some other less malign reason then in general no 
additional penalties should be issued further than the ones listed above 
for unintentional errors which include replays and are thus fairly 
harsh.  However, any intentional error reflects on the coach's integrity 
and therefore on the league's desire to continue the membership of that 
coach.
