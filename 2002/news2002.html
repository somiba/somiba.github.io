  Scott swh008@msn.com, gonzo31@aol.com, Herzog stl_cards@earthlink.net, and
Charles c_arnett@verizon.net expressed an interest in joining the league


5/24/2003 MIL at WHI playoff round 1
  All 5 games of this series were played face-to-face; both MIL and WHI submitted
12-man rosters as indicated in the rules (see playoff page for those rosters)
and WHI's did not include Gugliotta; unfortunately, WHI played Gugliotta for
significant minutes in every game (see playoff box scores page) and won games
3, 4, and 5.
  In addition, in game 2 Gugliotta, Mutombo, Jo.Smith, and Fortson combined for
102 minutes but all 4 of those play only PF and C and the game did not go overtime
so one of them must have been played out of position for at least 4 minutes in that
game which was won by MIL.
  The EC voted 5-0 that the Constitution Addendum (see link on main page) is very
clear in this case that since a player was inappropriately used in games won by
that team the games must be replayed.  Scott/MIL tells me that AaronK/WHI is out
of town until 5/27 so I will e-mail Aaron letting him know what's going on and
Aaron and Scott will have a choice of either playing these 3 games face-to-face
(with no Gugliotta of course and also with either Fowlkes or Dickerson also
ineligible since Gugliotta's games 1 and 2 performance will stand and neither
Fowlkes nor Dickerson appeared in a game) or via gameplan and if the latter then
I will ask that Aaron send to Scott and to me a game 3 gameplan hopefully by
5/28 evening.
  As an fyi there is a prior precedent of a playoff game being replayed due to
incorrect usage of a player not on the 12-man roster and in that case the usage
was for fewer minutes and was a substitution performed by the computer due to an
oversight of the away coach.
  As for the usage of Gugliotta in games 1 and 2 and the apparent usage out of
position of someone in game 2 these will be dealt with next season in WHI games
against MIL.
  Game 3 was replayed 5/30 and won by MIL.

4/22/2003
  chuckarnett@msn.com has expressed a strong interest in joining the league next season


3/30/2003 q3 autoplayed games
  whisun51 (won by sun) and whisun69 (won by whi) -- these game results apparently were
sent by Charles days earlier but they were not at all received and Charles was out of
town from just after the time he sent the files to a day after the deadline
  porwhi58 (won by por) and porwhi68 (won by por) -- I have not heard from AaronK as
to why these game results were apparently not sent


3/10/2003
  Nigel nigel@ahye.org has expressed a strong interest in rejoining the league next
season if the game is fully compatible with WinXP; Nigel was in the league before


2/19/2003
  Greg/VAL points out that he accidentally used B.Sundov for more minutes than allowed
during the season; Greg will not use Sundov any more this season and will be careful
about other players' minutes and Sundov's (or another similar player's) penalty will
be assessed next year as normal


2/14/2003
  Pat scrubfield@aol.com has expressed a strong interest in joining the league next
season


2/8/2003 second quarter autoplayed games
  none


2/8/2003 davdak40 protest
  Dak accidentally used A.Carter in this game (instead of T.Lue) but A.Carter was
supposed to be ineligible (see below) and this game was won by Dak; Brian/Dav
decided to protest this game (in accordance with the rule voted in before this
season) but it was decided 5-0 by the EC (Ed, Rick, Charles, Jeff, and Dale)
that A.Carter had too little of an impact in this 108-81 Dak win


2/7/2003 Dak second quarter games
  Jason/Dak pointed out that in several of his games this quarter he accidentally was
reading his games missed list instead of his days missed list; consequently, in many
games players were used even though they were supposed to be ineligible:
  DakLex37, A.Carter was incorrectly used
  WalDak38, A.Carter was incorrectly used
  DakNor39, A.Carter was incorrectly used
  DavDak40, A.Carter was incorrectly used
  CenDak41, A.Carter was incorrectly used
  DakCen48, T.Lue and L.Odom were incorrectly used
  The EC ruled 5-0 that A.Carter will need to miss daklex92, waldak69, daknor87, davdak77,
and cendak76 and that Odom will need to miss dakcen89; Lue will not be able to miss
dakcen89 and so Lue (or a similar player on dak's 10-man roster if Lue is not on any
10-man roster next season) will be reduced by two games of eligibility next season


1/2/2003 (posted 1/12/2003) Press Defense for SUN
  Charles/SUN noticed a rule which indicates that the press defense must be turned off
with a 10-point lead -- I have since updated this rule which was voted in a couple of
years ago in the Constitution and rules summary web pages as suggested by Charles --
and Charles went back and checked all of his season's home games so far to see if he
may have unknowingly violated this rule; Charles found that in the home games where he
was ahead by 10+ points (not including censun15 where SUN was not ahead by 10+ until
the final 2 minutes of the game when Charles would not have been pressing) he may or
may not have been pressing with a 10+ point lead in harsun01, milsun03, sousun07, and
daksun13; Charles had no way of remembering if he actually did violate this rule but
he did want to bring it to the league's attention (Charles did not save the txt file
containing detailed play-by-play as this file is not required by the league).
  The Executive Committee (EC) decided by a very narrow tie-breaking margin that the
penalty for this possible violation (there is no way of knowing if a violation actually
occurred but the EC agreed that there should be some penalty) is to limit the use of the
press defense in the next SUN home game for each of these teams (HAR, MIL, SOU, and DAK)
to 9 minutes instead of the regular maximum of 12; limiting to 6 minutes instead of 9
was a very narrow second place in the voting


1/1/2003 gonzo31@aol.com has expressed an interest in joining the league next season


11/23/2002 Accidental Overusage
  Don/HAR points out that in indhar16 he accidentally incorrectly used G.Long for 7
minutes; no protest was reported by JJ (I'm sure he didn't notice the error) and so
G.Long will miss indhar35 (a game G.Long was scheduled to play) instead; this has been
reflected on the league roster web link (but not on the Excel spreadsheet roster link)

11/17/2002 Scheduling
  Each team plays 3 home games against each opponent except for 1 team determined at
random against which they play only 2; the following lists a team followed by the
opponent against which will play only 2 home games:  DAK-MIL, DAV-SUN, LAK-SOU,
POR-NOR, SUN-DAK, VAL-LAK, WAL-IND, CEN-POR, HAR-WAL, IND-CEN, LEX-VAL, LOS-LEX,
MIL-LOS, NOR-HAR, SOU-DAV; the schedule was auto-created by the computer with 3
home games per team and then starting from the last day of the schedule and working
backwards the appropriate games above were removed from the schedule


11/9/2002 Player Overusage Penalties from last season
  It was voted 3-0 (Jeff, Charles, and Ed chose to vote on this topic) by the
Executive Committee that all penalties should be assigned the standard double
the overusage from last season; see last season's news link for details of overusage
  * GAL, MIC, and BRO are gone and NOR had the penalties in the playoffs
  * SOU -- McKey's minutes are reduced by 82 and MacCulloch's minutes are
    reduced by 10; this is two years in a row for SOU, any future year in which
    there is player overusage will likely be penalized with draft picks
  * LOS -- Av.Johnson's games are reduced by 2
  * CEN -- Medvedenko's minutes are reduced by 10
  * HAR no longer has A.Goldwire nor Q.Lewis so similar players from the current
    10-man roster are reduced -- Eisley's minutes are reduced by 60 and Garrity's
    minutes are reduced by 20
