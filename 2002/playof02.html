Here is a recap of what each playoff participant should do after downloading
  and installing the league file:

1) Look at the league news page (or the bottom of this e-mail) for your
  player overusage and what it means regarding the playoffs; if you have
  any questions please don't hesitate to let me know, these rulings are
  standard league guidelines

2) Send to me (but not to your opponent) a list of your 12 players who will
  be eligible in round 1 (you may have a different 12 in each round); note that
  players who played 1-14 NBA games may only play in 1 game each
  series, players who played in 15-29 NBA games may only play in 2
  games each series, players who played in 30-40 NBA games may only
  play in 3 games each series, while 41+ NBA games = unlimited; a coach
  need not announce before each game which game(s) a player will play,
  for example if Smith is eligible for 2 games he may play any 2 games at
  any time and this need not be announced beforehand

3) Once I receive both teams' 12-man rosters I will post them on the
  playoff web page and then the away coach should send a gpl for game
  1 to me and to his opponent (within the same e-mail); I will not be
  posting these gpl's on the web page

4) The home coach should play game 1 and send the zip file result
  (containing at least the gfl and prt files) to me and to his opponent
  (within the same e-mail)

5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until one team has won 3 games

6) Brian and I will replace the "me" above with "Rick" so that we will
  send Rick the rosters and cc Rick on all gpl's and game results; Rick,
  when you receive both rosters please e-mail them both back to both
  Brian and me; Rick, if you would like me to choose another for this
  please don't hesitate to let me know

7) Rules are the same as during the regular season except that there
  are no games or minutes limits (other than what's listed in steps 1
  and 2 above); there is no home court advantage, for example

8) If you have any questions please don't hesitate to let me know, it
  is much more preferable for you to ask me a question than for you to
  make a mistake in understanding.

There is no definitive deadline for games; however, please play games
  and send gpl's/rosters within a few days of when you can so that we
  can finish the first round by approximately 5/18.
As always, if you will not be checking e-mail for a few days or you will
  not be able to play a game or send a gpl within a few days please let
  me know.
