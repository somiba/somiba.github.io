<p>3/17/2017 Inadvertent Wall overusage<br>
Scottsdale was scheduled to play 3 straight home games against
Nazareth.  A gameplan was provided for the first two games with Kawhi
Leonard sitting and one was provided for the third game with John Wall
sitting.  Rich accidentally used the same gameplan for all 3 games.
The 3rd game was won by Scottsdale.  The EC ruled 3-0 (Brian, Laird,
and Rick voting) to allow a 1 game overusage by John Wall.

<p>2/19/2017 Nazareth Roster Addition<br>
Rich requested to add an additional player because several of his big
men were on track for overusage.  His team only had 15 players, so the
EC voted unanimously (Charles, Brian, Laird, and Rick) to allow him to
pick up one additional player for the fourth quarter, with that player
to be cut before the next season.  Rich selected DeJuan Blair.</p>
