<p>4/3/2019 Kyle Anderson usage<br>
Kyle Anderson was illegally used in lexsco76.  The usage was
discovered too late to apply a penalty, but Anderson was removed from
scomad72 to ensure he did not exceed his usage limits.
</p>

<p>4/1/2019 Q4 Deadline<br>
MADRHO67 and SANANA67 were autoplayed.
</p>    

<p>2/25/2019 Q3 Deadline<br>
ANARHO42 and RHOANA43 were autoplayed.
</p>    

<p>1/22/2019 Trade Adjustments<br>
Jrue Holiday was scheduled to miss game 84, but SCO's last game was
day 83, so the missed game was swapped.  All other traded players are
fully eligible in the second half of the season.
</p>

<p>1/21/2019 Q2 Deadline<br>
REAANA30, MADANA41, BAYRHO33, TEMRHO34, DAVRHO39, and LAKRHO41 were autoplayed.

<p>1/7/2018 Madison overusage<br>
Trevor accidentally played an ineligible De'Aaron Fox in maddav01,
madana03, madbay06, and madlak09.  The EC has ruled unanimously to
make him ineligible  for maddav29, madana41, baymad45, and lakmad69.
</p>

<p>1/7/2018 Tulsa overusage<br>
Philip accidentally sat an eligible Kevin Durant and played an
ineligible Dion Waiters in lextul15, anatul16, tultem17, reatul18,
tullak19, mintul20, and kentul20.  The EC has ruled unanimously to
make Waiters ineligible for lextul68, tulmin72, tulken78, and
tulrea79.  Because Waiters only is eligible again after day 66,
Alec Burks was chosen as the closest player to serve the remainder of
the penalty, and is ineligible for tultem26, laktul61, and tulana38.
</p>
