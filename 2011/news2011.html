<p>5/11/2012 grelak68<br>
Mike did not send a gameplan for grelak68, so one was generated with
the default defensive profile using grelex70, which had the same
ineligible players.

<p>5/11/2012<br>
In suntem10 Jordan Hill and Maurice Evans played when they were
scheduled to be ineligible.  By an EC vote of 3-0 (Brian, Donald, and
Ed) they will miss the last remaining game between the teams, temsun91.

miss his first road game against VER, sunver43.
</p>
