<PRE>                                RULES DISCUSSIONS

Please send any comments about potential rules or responses to below to NFLed@aol.com
  and I would be happy to post it on these pages that evening.



                           RULE VOTES -- FINAL RESULTS

Please disqualify yourself from voting unless/until you read the discussions of
  these issues on the league web page.  All returning league members may, if they
  want, participate in this.  If you have no preference one way or the other on a
  particular issue then please do not vote on that issue.  Also, only returning
  league members may vote (but of course I will post all further
  comments on the web page).

Each #1 choice vote counts 2 points and each #2 choice counts 1 point.
  If any single choice gets over 50% of all of the points then that choice is
  a new rule in the league.  If no single choice gets over 50% of all of the
  points for that rule then there will be a runoff of the top two point totals.

Final Votes:


1. PRESS DEFENSE

a) Stay with the current system, no limitations to the press defense;

b) Only allowed to be turned on in second half when behind in game, must
  be immediately turned off if ahead by 5 or more points;

c) Only allowed to be turned on in fourth quarter when behind in game, must
  be immediately turned off if ahead by 5 or more points;

d) Only allowed for a total of 12 minutes per game, can never press when
  ahead by 10+ points and must immediately turn off press when ahead by
  10+ points.


Ed votes d
Charles votes d then a
Peter votes a then b
Dale votes a
Allen votes c then b
Rick votes d then b

A runoff ballot will decide between options a and d:
Ed votes d
Charles votes d
Allen votes d
Peter votes a
Dale votes a
Rick votes d

Option d wins by majority runoff vote



2. WHO PLAYS HOME GAMES

a) Stay with the current system, when the game is scheduled to be team XXX
  at team YYY then the coach of team XXX sends a gameplan to the coach of
  team YYY;

b) When the game is scheduled to be team XXX at team YYY then the coach
  of team YYY sends a gameplan to the coach of team XXX.

Note that in both proposals we continue to use the "neutral court" setting.


Ed votes a
Charles votes a
Peter votes a
Dale votes a
Allen votes a
Rick votes a

Option a wins by unanimous vote



3. LINEUP RESTRICTIONS

a) Stay with the current system, if a player is rated by SOMBK for at least
  one minute at any particular position then he may play that position as
  much as his coach wants;

b) If a player is rated by SOMBK with exactly one minute at any particular
  position then this position is considered a secondary position, a team
  may not have two or more players playing a secondary position at any
  one time;

c) Lets call the position at which the player has the most rated minutes
  his major position; player A must play his major position unless there is
  another player who has the same major position as Player A playing
  Player A's major position or doing so would make it impossible to place
  a player at all 5 positions.


Ed votes a then b
Charles votes a then b
Peter votes a
Dale votes a
Allen votes c
Rick votes b then a

Option a wins by majority vote receiving 9 voting points out of a total 15



4. THROWING OLD TEAM INTO THE EXPANSION POOL AND REDRAFTING

a) Allow it with no restrictions*;

b) Allow it only for coaches who have been in the league for 2 years or less*,
  this is reflective of how long the coach has been in the league but not how
  long the coach has owned a particular team;

c) Allow it only for coaches who have had the team they are about to throw
  in for at least 3 years*;

d) Disallow it*.

* Note that the EC will retain flexibility in making the final decision.  It is not
  acceptable to have a completely rigid rule in this case as we must allow for
  extraordinary occurrences.  Also note that no league members have expressed a
  desire to throw in their team.


Charles votes c then d
Peter votes a
Dale votes d
Allen votes d
Rick votes a then c

A runoff ballot will decide between options a and d:
Charles votes d
Allen votes d
Peter votes a
Dale votes d
Rick votes a

Option d wins by majority runoff vote



As an additional vote on this topic:

i) The coach drafts in the rookie/free-agent draft as if a completely new team;

ii) Assign rookie/free-agent draft picks to correspond with the team given up or
  as a new team, whichever is lowest each round; in other words, if coach A
  wins the championship and then throws in his team then he will draft last in
  the rookie/free-agent draft even though he now has a new team, also if coach
  A traded away his 2nd round draft pick then if he decides to throw in his team
  he would not have a 2nd round pick (this does not apply to additional draft
  picks gained, however)


Peter votes ii
Dale votes ii
Allen votes ii
Rick votes ii

Option ii wins by unanimous vote
