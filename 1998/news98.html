<PRE>5/31/1999 Draft Lottery -- based upon a die roll of 4 MIL will have
  the first pick of next season's rookie/free-agent draft followed
  by NOR and then BUF (of returning teams); this lottery result is
  not official and will not at all count unless at the date of the
  beginning of the 1999-2000 administrative season (approximately
  a few weeks after sombk releases the team disk) all three of
  those teams still fully intend to play in the upcoming season.


June Dakota playoffs
  After approximately mid-June Jason was not available to play in
  any playoff games so he sent to Ed a gameplan to use in all playoff
  home games (which were autoplayed with also the away team's gameplan)
  and autoplayed games (with all defensive settings set to zero).


May/June WALDAK playoffs
  After winning the series 3 games to 2, Ed noticed that WAL had
  used McCarty in game 2 (a road game) for 6 very good minutes --
  in Ed's gameplan he had unintentionally listed McCarty as eligible
  and while McCarty was not in the lineup grid the computer did put
  him in the game when players were in foul trouble; since Mike was
  scheduled to play Ed in round 2 both Mike and Ed were disqualified
  from ruling in this situation; Rick decided that it was up to Jason
  if he wanted a replay of the game; Jason had mostly stopped reading
  e-mails (due to the fact that he had thought himself out of the
  playoffs) but after about a week he declined to make a decision and
  instead asked Rick for a league vote; Rick put the issue up to a
  league vote which ended up in a 7-6 vote in favor of replaying the
  game in an autoplay; using gameplans sent by Ed and Jason game 2
  was replayed with DAK winning, however Ed noticed that Divac was
  used in this replay but was supposed to be ineligible in this game
  due to regular season overuse; Rick decided that another replay
  was in order and also decided that since he would be out of town
  for awhile he would have Frank (a former league officer) handle
  the situation; using gameplans sent by Ed and Jason another game
  2 was replayed (by Frank) with DAK winning; prior to either replay
  Rick had said that if both Jason and Ed wanted to replay the rest
  of the entire series (after game 2) then that would be done but at
  that time Ed did not want to do that so DAK wins the series 3-0;
  the situation for game 2 was resolved in a 3-week period of time.


May WILMAD playoffs
  For MAD due to regular season overuse K.Gill was ineligible to
  play in games 1 and 2 though Tom had decided before the series
  that Gill would be eligible for the WILMAD playoff series and
  C.Crawford would not; however, Tom played game 2 (a home game)
  with C.Crawford playing 12 very good minutes and indicated that
  he decided to make C.Crawford eligible for the series while
  making K.Gill ineligible; Ed ruled that while this is not an
  acceptable thing to decide without league approval it is not a
  problem for this particular case since Crawford for 4 games is
  not as good as Gill for 3 games, Mike and Rick agreed while
  Allen did not choose to comment (until much later when he said
  that having his opponent play with his 12 best is fine with him).


REGULAR SEASON OVERUSES

DAK Divac played 65 games but was eligible 64 games -- must miss the
  first 2 games of the playoffs
WIL Donyell Marshall played 72 games but was eligible 71 games -- must
  miss the first 2 games of the playoffs
KAU Nordgaard played 75 minutes but was eligible for 50 minutes --
  must miss the first 12 games of the playoffs and may only play in 2
  minutes of the 13th game
MAD K.Gill played 82 games but was eligible 81 games -- must miss the
  first 2 games of the playoffs
FRE Brandon played 51 games but was eligible for 50 games -- must miss
  the first 2 games of the playoffs; B.Grant played 62 games but was
  eligible for 61 games -- must miss the first 2 games of the playoffs;
  E.Gray played 32 games but was eligible for 30 games -- must miss the
  first 4 games of the playoffs; Milic played 195 but was eligible for
  171 minutes -- must miss the first 9 games of the playoffs and may
  only play in 3 minutes of the 10th game; Mike indicates that regarding
  the game overuses he had been using the "games missed list" (which was
  still up on this news page) rather than the "days missed list" on the
  rosters.
BUF C.O'Bannon 31/30 games
HAR none (Gugliotta's stats were adjusted, was a stats mistake on a
  manual gamefile creation)
IND Recasner 60/59 games
IRO J.Howard 65/64 games; Harrington 1062/948 minutes; Pollard 373/333
  minutes
NOR Foyle 56/55 games; Blount 71/70 games
SOU Mayberry 80/79 games; Horry 73/72 games
MIL Sprewell 575/574 minutes; McGrady 1262/1238 minutes; Rhodes 1250/1124
  minutes; E.Snow 1112/964 minutes; Mi.Williams 222/169 minutes; J.Vaughn
  447/440 minutes; L.Green 180/130 minutes
WOO M.Stewart 1557/1527 minutes (second year in a row of M.Steward overuse
  by WOO)


5/2/99 4th quarter autoplayed games
  madwoo79, nordak75


4/21/99 wilkau79
  Peter e-mailed Allen and me that he had not received this
  gameplan; 4/24/99 late evening I sent a default gameplan
  to Peter.


3/26/99 Ironton
  Michael hasn't made any contact with the league (including
  having missed legal gameplan and game result deadlines) since
  3/1/99 despite league efforts to contact him; team Ironton is
  vacated; gameplans will be default (let computer decide) and
  games will be autoplayed.


3/21/99 3rd quarter autoplayed games (*=with away gameplan):
  souiro44*, suniro46*, noriro48, indiro49, wiliro50,
  lakiro52*, bufiro58*, freiro61, waliro62*; iromil56,
  walmil61*, normil62, woomil63; kausou54; wilwoo61;
  milmad50.


3/21/99 milmad50
  Tom today notified me that Frank had not sent a gameplan
  (as they usually play face-to-face); Tom was unable to get
  from Frank a gameplan by the deadline so Tom sent me a
  gameplan and the game was autoplayed.


3/19/99 kausou54
  Default gameplan sent for kau as Peter hadn't sent this
  gameplan; as it turned out, game was autoplayed.


3/12/99 q3 Ironton
  Haven't heard from Michael since 3/1/99; will begin to send
  default gameplans as requested 3/14/99; default gameplans.


3/1/99 q3 Ironton
  Michael pointed out that he accidentally set Hurley and
  Pollard in away gameplans and sent the league an e-mail
  about the situation; in the meantime, in irohar51, irokau45
  (played 3/5/99), irowoo60 (played 3/20/99 even though Jim
  had a default gameplan from me) and in irobuf53 both
  players were used while in irofre57 Hurley was used;
  Hurley will miss irobuf75 while the remainder of the
  additional missed games will be applied next season on a
  one-for-one basis (for a different but similar player if
  one of these players is not on the team next year).


2/27/99 bufwoo44
  Jim pointed out that he accidentally used D.Strong in bufwoo44
  so Strong must miss the next bufwoo game which is bufwoo70.


1/31/99 2nd quarter late game results and gameplans:

Jason didn't send dakhar43.gpl by the 2nd quarter deadline (not
  realizing that it was a 2nd quarter game) and then sent it after
  being notified, game had to be autoplayed
Jason didn't send game results woodak24 and sundak35 (he had
  forgotten to attach the files to the e-mails) until 1:30 p.m.
  PST the day after the deadline

Don didn't notify me about the missing dakhar43.gpl until
  two days before the game result deadline - game dakhar43
  was autoplayed with default gameplans

Michael didn't play and send me any 2nd quarter home game
  results until 1:30 p.m. PST the day after the deadline at which
  time he successfully sent me all game results

Aaron didn't successfully send me daksou23, irosou39, and
  madsou42 (he tried to send them to me 1/31 but the file
  attachment was unreadable) so these games were autoplayed

Allen's PC couldn't read either gpl sent by Aaron for souwil41
  (though I could on my PC) so game was autoplayed with gpl's
  from both coaches - no problem


01/24/99 wilhar24
  When Don manually recreated the lost gfl file from the prt
  file for this game Michael Jordan's stats were mistakenly
  given to Tom Gugliotta; this stat mistake will be corrected
  on the final season stats but currently the league stats
  show one extra game played for Gugliotta and one fewer game
  played for Jordan than was actually the case.


01/17/99 wooind26 and wooind43
  JJ reports that he didn't receive these gameplans and Jim
  acknowledged that he had sent them to the wrong address and
  resent them to the correct address tonight.


01/14/99 team Ironton
  Michael noticed that Ed had made an error transcribing J.Howard's
  games missed onto the days missed list; J.Howard's days missed
  should have been 33-41,79-95 but was instead mistakenly listed as
  48-77 (accidentally duplicating J.Thomas' days missed list); since
  J.Howard has already played in hariro34 and madiro38 J.Howard will
  need to miss irohar51 (there are no hariro games remaining this
  season) and madiro74, in neither game is another star forward
  scheduled to miss; J.Howard's days missed has been updated on
  the rosters of the web page.


12/22/98 team Madison
  For an apparently technical reason Tom is unable to create all
  of the gfl files manually from the prt files; to finally end
  the first quarter Ed has decided that Ed will autoplay all of
  the nine Madison home games affected with 9 away gameplans
  forwarded by Tom.


12/20/98 team Madison
  Tom accidently didn't save the gfl file game results of his first
  quarter games so the evening of 12/21/98 he will create each of
  the gfl files manually from the saved prt files.


12/20/98 team Woodridge
  Jim accidently mis-named his first quarter zip file game results
  but they were close enough to be easily renamed by Ed.


12/19/98 madfre14
  Fremont played madfre14 with a default gameplan sent by Ed since Tom
  never sent a gameplan to Mike's new address.  Reminder had been sent
  to Tom 12/17/98.


12/16/98 team Dakota
  Corrected mistake made by Ed noticed by Jason on D.Harper's missed games.


12/04/98 team Fremont
  Notified league that old e-mail address hasn't been working and
  gave new e-mail address (see rosters).  Deadline for sending
  gameplans to Mike extended several days due to e-mail change.


12/04/98 walind21
  IND pointed out that IND accidentally used J.R.Reid so J.R.Reid
  must rest for walind35.


11/13/98 soubuf05
  BUF pointed out that BUF accidentally used Kittles instead of Billups
  (thinking that it was day 02) so Kittles must rest for soubuf49.

WIL  Williamson was overused 25 minutes so will be

  listed on the roster;
WIL  D.Fisher was overused 20 minutes so will be
  allowed to play 40 fewer minutes this year than currently
  listed on the roster;

  to play 4 fewer games this year than currently listed on

  listed on the roster;

  SEA roster and so Donyell Marshall will be allowed to play
  2 fewer games this year than currently listed on the roster;
SEA  Lister was overused 161 minutes but is no longer
  on the SEA roster and so M.Stewart will be allowed
  to play 322 fewer minutes this year than currently listed

  year as a monster rebounder);

IRO  D.Curry was overused 1 game so will be allowed

NOR  McIlvaine was overused 1 game so will be allowed

MAD  Piatkowski was overused 135 minutes but missed
  60 minutes in the playoffs (12 min/g x 5 games) so will
  be allowed to play 210 (270-60) fewer minutes this year than
  currently listed on the roster;
MAD  R.Geary was overused 137 minutes but missed 35
  minutes in the playoffs (7 min/g x 5 games) but is no longer
  on the MAD roster so L.Harris will be allowed to play
  239 (274-35) fewer minutes this year than currently listed on
  the roster;

MIL  Horry was overused 2 games but missed 4 games in
  the playoffs so will not need any further adjustment;

HAR  R.Pack was overused 2 games but missed 4 games in
  the playoffs so will not need any further adjustment.

[In some cases the overusage was probably due to setting
  0 minutes in the fatigue grid on a road game but forgetting
  to set the player as ineligible.]
