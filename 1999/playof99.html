Playoff preview:

KAU #1 vs. MIL #8 -- Kau has dominated play in general during the regular
season especially in close games with an amazing 15-2 record in games
decided by 5 points or less.  Mil will need to avoid sparking Kau's
consistent fastbreak too often either by shooting for a good percentage
which is tough to do against Kau's solid defense or crashing the offensive
boards and will need to somehow contain Kau's Grant Hill (we may or may not
see Paul Pierce guarding Hill preventing a size disadvantage post-up
inside).  If Mil can limit the dazzlers Kau gets from Hill, Pippen, and
Bibby then Mil's Terrell Brandon can run a pretty mean fastbreak himself.
Kau won 4 of the 6 regular season matchups.

MAD #2 vs. SUN #7 -- Mad's edge is their awesome starting lineup and had a
great 10-2 record in games decided by 5 points or less.  If Sun can get Mad
starters in foul trouble that could be important as Mad's bench is
comparitively weak.  Sun's Mutombo should be a great matchup against Mad's
Mourning and also should help out with blocks on offensive stars McDyess and
Abdur-Rahim.  Mad's fastbreak is devastating with Kidd at the point so Sun
will have to shoot a high percentage and/or crash the offensive boards but
both will be difficult against the solid Mad defense and rebounding.  Mad
won all 4 regular season games between these two teams.

WAL #3 vs. WIL #6 -- Wal's strength is their consistent defense leading the
league with 86.7 points per game allowed.  Wil will of course need to rely
on their twin towers Duncan and Robinson as Wal will use a
center-by-committee approach to try to limit Robinson.  With Wal's 39-2
regular season home record it will be tough for Wil to overcome this for a
road win but by containing Wal's home mvp David Wesley Wil's league-leading
.364 3-point shooting could overcome Wal's nearly league-leading .273
3-point defense.  Wal led the league in turnovers forced and committed more
turnovers than almost every other team while Wil led the league in free
throws attempted.  Wal won 5 out of the 6 regular season meetings.

LAK #4 vs. DAK #5 -- Lak has Shaq-daddy and well-known name support while
Dak has the mailman Malone and Barkley's final full season.  Dak slipped
from #4 to #5 with all of the autoplay losses at the end of the season and
will have problems matching up Divac and whomever else he puts at center
against Shaq but similarly Lak will have problems matching up on Malone (as
everyone does).  The games will probably come down to the support players as
Lak's Steve Smith and Vince Carter could get hot or Dak's Barkley could
dominate the put-backs and Avery Johnson could get lots of dazzlers.  This
should be a very close series either way as the teams split their 4 regular
season meetings.
