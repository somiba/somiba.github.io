<PRE>DAKOTA at KAUKAUNA Round 3 Game 1 (autoplayed)

Kaukauna led 63-47 at the half but Dakota made a furious run
  to pull to within one point at 83-82 after three quarters.
  Mookie Blaylock, though, had 17 second-half points (ending
  the game with 30) on 12-16 shooting and Kaukauna held on
  for an exciting 117-115 victory.



DAKOTA at KAUKAUNA Round 3 Game 2

First quarter ended with Kaukauna ahead 39-27.  Mookie
and G-Dog Hill both had 9pts, and Kau. outrebounded
Dakota 11-1.  Second quarter continued with Kau in the
lead, but Dakota made a strong run and took the lead at
63-61. Karl Malone kept yelling, "gimme the ball."  At
one point, he even knocked Clyde Drexler over to get it.  

Dakota lead 77-75 with 6 minutes left in the third, when
Kaukauna's gunners became red-hot with Mark Price and
Eddie Jones each hitting two 3-pters apiece.  Price scored
12 during this stretch and Kaukauna never trailed again.

Malone continued to hog the ball and whine to officials
for fouls during the fourth, adding to his game leading
scoring.  Grant Hill, however, dominated the quarter with
10 of his 27 points and key posting up of Avery Johnson.
Hill finished with 27 pts and 12 assists.  Malone finished
with a greedy 35.  Coach Pendleton exclaimed after the
game, "That bastard [Malone] sure does whine alot...Every
one of my players that played scored at least once and
eight of the 11 that played were in double figures...that
says oodles about the commitment to winning as a team
that Kaukauna has, unlike that Malone and 11 other guys
from Dakota."











DAKOTA at HAYWARD Round 2 Game 1 (autoplayed)

This was a very close game.  I could tell by watching
the bars on the autoplay...  It was only until it was over
that it was over and I saw that Hayward had pulled it
out, 97 - 94.  Penny had 35.



DAKOTA at HAYWARD Round 2 Game 2

Penny scored the first two points of the game on foul shots
  but Dakota went on a 6-0 run to take an early lead in a
  low-scoring and whistle-plagued first few minutes.  Avery
  picked up two quick fouls but Derek Harper more than
  filled in the breach with 12 first quarter points.  With a
  four-point lead Drexler made a half-court buzzer-beater
  to finish the quarter 29-22 Dakota.
In the second quarter Dakota pushed ahead 35-24 but
  Hayward came back with a 6-0 run of its own.  The
  Dakota lead fluctuated between 4 and 8 until the end
  of the half with Dakota holding a 55-47 edge after a Ron
  Harper steal and layup at the second quarter buzzer.
  While Dakota was being outrebounded at the half by 5 or
  so and Hayward took the lion's share of free-throw
  attempts, Dakota was making a higher percentage of
  shots 48% to 38%.  Despite Hayward's near-league-low
  turnover rate Hayward committed an astounding 17 first
  half turnovers, two on Webber offensive fouls and a total
  of four "home court advantage" turnovers (the turnovers
  the computer would give to the visiting team except that
  with our "neutral court" setting the computer gives them
  to both teams equally, although Dakota committed none
  in this game).  Hayward ended the game with 6 "home
  court advantage" turnovers.
The third quarter began with Sabonis continuing his hot
  shooting as Hayward could still get no closer than 4.
  In the last few minutes of the third quarter Drexler and
  Malone dished off one dazzling pass after another and
  Derek Harper continued his hot shooting while Webber
  through three quarters contributed almost nothing.
  Dakota went on an 11-4 run towards the end of the
  quarter and led after three quarters 88-73.
Early in the fourth quarter Dakota led 92-73 but Hayward
  began a comeback with Penny heating up.  At one
  point Ervin Johnson blocked four shots in a row as
  Hayward pulled to within 8 at 103-95 but Karl Malone
  who had had a steady though unspectacular game up
  to this point hit a few buckets and free throws as
  Dakota finished the game with a 115-100 victory.
Dakota shot 56% from the floor including 10-17 by
  Derek Harper.  Malone ended up with 28 points on
  only 8-21 shooting but Dakota committed only 9
  turnovers against one of the league leaders in forcing
  turnovers Hayward who committed 21 themselves.
  Hayward was 34-37 from the free-throw line and
  outrebounded Dakota 37-29.  Penny ended the game
  with 35 points on 14-15 from the free-throw line and
  Sabonis had 26.



HAYWARD at DAKOTA Round 2 Game 3

It was very close throughout the game, despite a poor
shouting from Malone (6-20), Seikaly (3-14), and
Vaught (1-6); a combined 10-40. I don't even want
to think about this game. It is about as bad as the
Jazz game against the Bulls.

Drexler had a pretty good game, but I didn't give him
the ball enough.

Webber had a great game posting up R.Harper and
company. Both Penny and Wesley had fine games.
The player of the game had to be E.Johnson (12reb,
3a, 3st, 5b). A very good game of E.J.

Game 4 in Dakota should be a little better.




HAYWARD at DAKOTA Round 2 Game 4

This game was a different story from game 3 and game 2. Both teams were
ready to play for this important game 4. Dakota needed to win to tie the
series and Hayward was looking to take a 3 to 1 lead over the Blizzards.

The first quarter started with Dakota taking an early lead. Russell pulled
Hayward closer with his amazing 3 point shooting, which was unstopable. Then
Dakota went on run to end the quarter with a 38-29 point lead. Both Malone
and Russell ended the quarter with 10 points (both Jazz players).

Hayward didn't like being down very much, so they came out in the 2nd
quarter and really took it at Dakota. Penny hit most of his shots in this
quarter and sparked a lead for Hayward with 5 minutes left in the quarter.
Dakota had lost it's lead but still managed a 54-51 lead at the half.

Hayward gained an early lead in the 3rd quarter, but
Dakota made a run to take a 8 point lead. Dakota lead
81-76 after quarter 3.

The 4th quarter was in interesting one. With an early
7 point lead the Dakota players became overconfident.
After only 4 minutes Dakota watched a lead turn into
nothing, dispite Penny's foul trouble. It didn't stop there
either. Lead by Sabonis and Russell, Hayward took an
amazing 6 point lead. Sabonis kept getting fouled in the
paint and Russell was nailing the 3's. This was a 13 point
turn around in only 6 minutes. Sabonis got fouled at about
the 6 minute mark with a Hayward 5 point lead. He missed
the 1st and made the second. This was a crucial point for
both teams. Either Hayward was going to hold on to this
lead to take a 3 to 1 lead or Dakota had some serious work
to do. Dakota was humbled after this 13 point turn around
and the players began playing some defense and score some
points. Seikaly got a hoop and made the free throw to cut
the lead to 3. Then Harper got a steal to bring the lead to 1.
The last half of the quarter was a close match. Both teams
wanted this game. Foul trouble hurt Hayward at the end of
the game. First, Penny went out on a foul on Avery. Sabonis
was the next to go on a foul by Seikaly. Webber was the last
on a offensive foul. Dakota took advantage and took a lead
in the last 2 minutes to win the game: 115-109.



DAKOTA at HAYWARD Round 2 Game 5

Hayward began the game scoring 8 straight points but Dakota
  quickly bounced back to score 9 straight points of their own.
  Malone was silent in the first quarter as Ron Harper and Clyde
  Drexler rained 3's as Dakota led 21-16 after 1 quarter.  Hot
  shooting by home starter LaPhonso Ellis kept Hayward in
  the game at that point.  Sabonis powered his way to 14 first
  quarter points but an incredible balanced rebounding effort
  by the visiting team kept Dakota ahead 31-29 at the end of
  the first quarter.
Early in the second quarter Malone contributed three dazzling
  passes but missed most of his few opportunities as the two
  teams played mostly even the entire quarter.  Sabonis and
  Ellis hit more shots but Ron Harper and Loy Vaught kept
  pace as Dakota closed the half with a 58-57 lead.
Sabonis kept up the heat in the third quarter finishing the
  quarter with a total of 30 points but game 3 star Bryon
  Russell missed several open outside shots against Ron
  Harper's tough defense and Dakota continued to widen its
  already amazing rebounding margin.  Too many Dakota
  fastbreak turnovers and continued sub-par play by Karl
  Malone kept Hayward hanging on.  Dakota ended the
  third quarter with an 89-86 lead.
The fourth quarter began with Clyde Drexler making a few
  baskets but with Sabonis on the bench due to fatigue
  Penny began to assert himself posting up Avery Johnson.
  With 5 minutes remaining Dakota held a tenuous 106-101
  lead as Hayward decided upon leaving Ellis in the game
  for his threat of 3's or bringing Sabonis back in completely
  fatigued.  After being left in the game Ellis blocked Seikaly's
  shot, grabbed the rebound, grabbed another rebound and
  set himself for a 3-pointer (against normal defense) with his
  team down 107-105 with 4 minutes remaining.
Ellis missed the 3 and Malone converted a powerful 3-point
  play on the other end.  Sabonis re-entered the game.
Wesley then set himself up for two free throws on an open
  outside foul by Avery.  Wesley made the first and missed
  the second but grabbed his own rebound and was fouled
  on the put-back attempt, making one more free throw.  On
  the next possession down 112-107 Wesley was fouled on
  another open outside shot but in a daring display of some
  tough-mindededness the referree called the sixth foul on Karl
  Malone.  "Malone, you're outta here!"  Wesley converted both
  free throws and Dakota led 112-109 with less than 3 minutes
  to go and Malone on the bench after shooting 5-13 on field
  goals and only 2-2 from the free throw line.
In came Vaught and Sabonis went to work.  On the next
  possession, though, it was Penny who took Drexler to
  the hoop for only a 112-111 Hayward deficit.  Facing
  retirement after next year, Drexler coolly sank a 3-pointer
  and after a Hayward turnover Vaught slam-dunked in
  Sabonis' face.
Down 117-111 with less than two minutes to go Hayward
  burned one of its four remaining timeouts to run a play
  for Sabonis.  Vaught gangsta-slapped the ball away but
  Ervin Johnson grabbed the rebound; Johnson ignored
  his teammates cries for timeout and put up a brick which
  Dakota grabbed (of course).  In the next minute Dakota,
  though, continued its trend of turnovers as Ellis hit two
  open outside shots (on offense/defense substitutions for
  Ervin Johnson) and Hayward called timeout down 117-115
  with 42 seconds remaining.
Running a play for Sabonis, Wesley passed to the big man
  for an open inside shot against Vaught.  Sabonis used a
  bit too much elbow and the refs again refused to swallow
  their whistle, calling an offensive foul on Sabonis with 31
  seconds to go in the game.  Sabonis said something seemingly
  vile in an unintelligible language.  Despite playing in Hayward
  by the time the refs. stopped play the clock read 22
  seconds so this forced Hayward to foul.
With 8 seconds to go and up 117-115 Vaught -- a 70%
  free throw shooter -- stepped to the line and made both
  shots.  Afterwards the clock spun to zero before Hayward
  could even get another Sabonis shot off and Dakota won
  the pivotal game 119-115.
Drexler went 11-15 from the field and 3-6 from 3-point range
  for a total of 26 points and Ron Harper had 22 points on 9-14
  field goal shooting (mostly on fastbreak and steal shots)
  and 3-5 from the 3-point line.  Ellis scored 27 points on 11-20
  field goals and 3-8 on 3's while Sabonis scored 30 on 8-12
  field goals and 12-15 free throws (plus 2-2 on 3's) but only
  grabbed 4 rebounds in 27 minutes.  While Hayward committed
  fewer turnovers 24-16, Dakota was able to shoot 8-16 on 3's
  all against the close defense (except on misses by Seikaly
  and Malone), and Hayward also shot 8-16 almost solely
  against normal defense.  Both teams shot 55% on field goals.
  The difference in the game, though, was an amazing Dakota
  rebounding margin 45-28 despite using a big lineup (with
  Vaught at RF) for only 8 minutes while Hayward used its big
  lineup (with Webber at RF and E.Johnson and Sabonis in at
  LF and C, though RF Ellis played 26 minutes) for a large
  portion of the game.  With a 45-28 rebounding margin obviously
  Dakota wanted the game more than did Hayward.



DAKOTA at HAYWARD Round 2 Game 7

Penny began the game very hot, scoring at will on Drexler and
  getting the old man in foul trouble but Hayward's other players
  were slow to start, though Hayward held a slight rebounding
  edge through most of the game.  Penny ended the game with
  33 points and Sabonis chipped in with 26.
Malone called for the ball and drove to the basket also grabbing
  several offensive rebounds -- not usually his strength -- when
  the offense wasn't run through him.  Malone ended the game
  with 41 points and 16 rebounds and Seikaly went 8-8 from the
  field in only 20 foul-plagued minutes.  Avery Johnson dished
  out 10 assists on mostly dazzling passes and Ron Harper
  and Drexler combined for 10 steals with most of those earned
  on their own cards.
In typical NBA style both teams enjoyed spurts of dominating
  play. Hayward led 28-23 until Dakota went on an 14-2 spurt
  helped by numerous steals (Dakota finished with 17 steals).
  Dakota led 37-30 when Hayward rattled off a 23-6 run but in
  the last six minutes of the first half Dakota went on a 22-9
  run to lead 65-62 at the break.
In the third quarter Dakota quickly built the lead up to 12 and
  kept the lead at around 10, ending the quarter with a 99-91
  lead.
In the fourth quarter Hayward could get no closer than 8 and
  in the last five minutes Hayward fouled on practically every
  otherwise unsuccessful Dakota shot attempt and Dakota
  pulled away to a 130-112 win.

In this interesting series out of the six games played by an
  active coach only one of those games was won by the
  home team.  Hayward won game one at home but this
  game was autoplayed.













MILWAUKEE at KAUKAUNA Round 2 Game 1 (autoplayed)

From the sum file:  The game was even until the middle of the
  1st quarter when Kau pulled ahead by 5 but Mil pushed
  ahead to lead 31-28 after 1 quarter.  Bobby Sura and Tyrone
  Hill had 11 and 9 1st quarter points, respectively.

Mil finished a 35-19 stretch with an 11-point lead midway
  through the 2nd quarter with Sprewell adding his scoring
  punch but Grant Hill led a comeback which brought Kau
  to within 2 at the half 63-61.

Mil pulled ahead by 6 midway through the 3rd quarter but
  Kau came back again to tie the game at 87 through 3.

The two teams played even through most of the 4th
  quarter as Kau then built a 3-point lead with 3 minutes
  remaining in the game.  Mil was unable to overcome
  that small lead and Kau won the game 111-107.



MILWAUKEE at KAUKAUNA Round 2 Game 2

Close game.  It is fairly non-descript and very close.  I
was ahead most of the game until late in the third and
thought you were gonna run right by me, but a couple
of key steals and turnovers on your part and I kept a
couple of point lead.  I only won by 6 or 7.



KAUKAUNA at MILWAUKEE Round 2 Game 3

Kaukauna wins...



KAUKAUNA at MILWAUKEE Round 2 Game 4

I was up 17 going into the fourth, and you cut it to 4 with
5 minutes to go, but then I surged for the win and stay alive.
KJ, Ewing, and Spre combined for 31-42 shooting, that's
getting it done.



MILWAUKEE at KAUKAUNA Round 2 Game 5

Game 5...Milwaukee visits Kaukauna down 3 games
to 1 in the second round of the playoffs...Fans pack the
Kaukauna Coliseum waiting expectantly...They yearn
for something after last year's dismal last place finish.

Kaukauna opens the game quickly jumping to a 25-11
lead in the 8 minutes, finishing the first quarter with a
36-24 lead.  Grant Hill leads Kau with 12 points on 5-6
shooting and Mookie adds 6 assists, mostly to Hill.
Milwaukee plays the Hack 'em all defense committing
11 fouls and turning the ball over 7 times.

Kaukauna maintains a small margin of 12 points throughout
the quarter.  Coach Pendleton constantly yells from the
bench for his team to set up the halfcourt offense and not
get into a running game with Milwaukee.  "Offensive
rebounds, steals and stops are what beats a team like 
Milwaukee, we don't want to get into a running game with
them.  And, they can't handle our depth and wealth of
talent." he claimed at halftime, with his team leading 67-52.
Hill leads with 20 points and Mookie contributes 11 on 4-4
shooting (3-3 3pters).

Kaukauna continues to cruise in the third quarter ending it
with a 93-81 lead.  Hills scores 7 in the quarter.  KJ scores
22 on 8-11 shooting and 10 assists in an effort to get his
team moving.

The first six minutes of the fourth quarter see Milwaukee
lead a comeback and tie the game at 97.  In the final six
minutes, chaos broke out with the lead changing 4 times.
Kau built a two point lead at 102-100, then Milwaukee
surged to a 107-106 lead.  Kaukauna then called a timeout.
Robert Horry leads Milwaukee in this quarter with 13
points in 4 minutes. The 5,234 fans that pack the Kau.
Colisseum screamed wildly during the timeout so that after
the game Latrell Sprewell said, "I couldn't hear anything so
I thought the coach just said shoot."  The last four minutes
the chaos continued but Kau pulls to a 114-112 win.

G Hill leads all scorers with 34 points and 7 assists. Mookie
scores 19 points and 13 assists.  KJ finishes with 22 and 12
assists and Horry finished with 20 points.













MILWAUKEE at LAKE K Round 1 Game 1

Milwaukee 121  Lake K 93
	Despite regular season troubles against Lake K, Milwaukee dominates this
contest (that seems to happen in the real NBA too).  Milwaukee got out to a quick 11-3
lead, but Lake K stormed back to tie the game at 13-13.  Lake K had only two leads in
the game at 24-22 and 25-24.  There were five ties during the first period including at
the end of the period when Barkley missed the second free throw and stuffed in his own
miss to end the period at 31-31.
	The game was tied at 33 and 35 until KJ (the league leader in threes with over
50% while taking almost 250 on the season!) hit consecutive three pointers with a normal
defense and double team.  Milwaukee never looked back from there and had a 65-52 lead
at the half.
	The game became a blowout when Milwaukee scored the first 12 points of the
second half and the lead balooned to over 30 at times.  Even big Muresan hit on the fast
break (when he is out running my guards, you know you are in trouble).
	KJ managed to tie Ewing for game high honors of 23 points while being doubled
the entire game.  He also had a game high 10 assists.  Sprewell was not in a choking mood
with a near triple double on 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists.  O'Neal was contained to
21 points and Barkley played big with 18 points and 16 rebounds.  Anderson had 11 points
in the first quarter but only managed 15 in the game.  Lake K just couldn't overcome 56%
to 42% FG shooting and shot a dismal 0 for 9 from downtown.



MILWAUKEE at LAKE K Round 1 Game 2

Lake K 133  Milwaukee 131  (Series tied at 1 to 1)
	This one was looking like a reversal of the first one, but give Milwaukee
credit for battling back and almost stealing a game that would have given them the
series for all intents and purposes.  Lake K started like they were playing a must
win game.  Lake K led early 10-4, and after a three pointer made it 10-7, Lake K
went on a 15-0 run to go up by 18.  Smith made four fastbreak shots during the
stretch (none were dazzlers).  After one period it was 40-24 and Lake K was
outshooting Milwaukee 62% to 43%.
	Lake K built the lead to 19 early in the second, but Milwaukee came back
to make it 54-44 midway through the second.  Lake K woke up and rebuilt the lead
to 21 at the half 75-54.
	After scoring the first hoop of the second half for their biggest lead of 23,
Lake K watched in horror as Milwaukee started an even more amazing comeback.
A 23-10 run got them back to within 10 at 87-77.  Lake K had it back to 15 after
two fouls by KJ on Dehere led to five points and then Ewing committed his fourth
on an offensive foul.  But this didn't even fazed Milwaukee.  After three it was 103-90.
	Milwaukee had foul trouble in the fourth but didn't lose anybody because
of it.  With 9:22 left, Milwaukee finally got it under double digits.  And less than half
way through the final period, it was down to 112-109.  The lead alternated between
five and one for awhile as Barkley hit all his foul attempts down the stretch.  The
game was won thanks to incredible foul shooting and clutch offensive rebounds.
With 4:05 left, it was 120-119.  O'Neal missed open, but Anderson got Lake K's
third offensive rebound and score in the last three possessions.  Anderson stole it,
but somehow lost it (it went by too fast to see), and Sprewell hit to make it 122-121.
Barkley missed an open inside shot, but Milwaukee missed on the FB to take their
first lead (Milwaukee never did lead in the entire game), and O'neal was stopped on
the FB on the other end by Sprewell, but Smith got another offensive rebound plus a
hoop and some harm.  It was now 125-121 with 2:43 left.
	Milwaukee scored the next four points to tie the game for the first time at
125-125 with 2:05 left.  Anderson drew the fifth on KJ and hit both FT's with 1:45 left.
Timeout Milwaukee.  The next 1:06 went by without me touching a key (I hate when
there is no control and no option for a timeout which is called after practically every
basket in the NBA).  Milwaukee missed after the timeout, Lake K got a FB dazzler,
Milwaukee returned with a dazzler, Lake K turned it over, and Ewing got fouled
during that stretch and it went by in a heartbeat.  He made both to tie the game again
with 0:39 left.  O'Neal scored on the other end, but KJ came right back with a dazzler
with 6 seconds left tying the game again at 131-131.  After a timeout, Anderson
switched on Trent and got the whistle on him (that happens all the time in Strat and
rarely in real basketball at the end of the game).  Once again Anderson hit both FT's
with only 0:03 left and a Milwaukee timeout.  I don't think I missed a free throw in
the fourth.  The ball went to Spree for three and the win but he missed and Ewing's
offensive rebound was too late.  Lake K escaped by the skin on their teeth.
	Player of the game was without a doubt Sprewell even in a losing effort.
He had a game high 42 points, dished out 8 assists, and played incredible defense
including that stop of Shaq on the break.  Barkley led Lake K with 28 points
including big three pointers while Milwaukee was sagging on him early in the fourth.
He had 9 rebounds at the half and only ended with 11, and Anderson had 8 assists at
the half and only ended with 11.  Despite 44% first half shooting by Milwaukee, they
ended up 57% for the game (must have shot about 70% in the second half surge).



LAKE K at MILWAUKEE Round 1 Game 3

Game three of the set moved to Milwaukee, where Lake K. came
out running and gunning.  They built a 37-25 first period lead. 
From there, they extended the lead to 67-50 at the half.  Lake K. 
could do no wrong, and Milwaukee could do nothing right.  It
looked like we were going to have a blowout on our hands, but
Milwaukee did not quit.

Three minutes into the second half, Shaq picked up his 4th foul
and was forced to the bench.  With four minutes remaining in the
third period, Milwaukee had cut the lead to 85-82, scoring 32
points over an 8 minute stretch.  Lake K. went on a little run, and
by the end of the third, had built their lead back to 9.

The fourth quarter began much as the third did.  Shaq returned to
action, and scored a couple of quick buckets, but once again
picked up another foul 3 minutes into the quarter.  He was forced
to just sit and watch with five fouls (I doubt Rick would have let
him sit).  Milwaukee put on a couple of runs, but could not get
closer than 5 points.  Then Lake K. went on an 8-0 run to give
themselves a 13 point edge with 3:30 remaining.  Shaq was back
in, but then picked up his 6th (you're outta here pal).  Less than a
minute later, Steve Smith joined him, and the lead was down to 10.
With 2 minutes remaining, the Beer Drinkers had shaved the lead
to 6.  They had a couple of chances to cut into that, but couldn't hit.
Kenny Anderson missed a big three, but Terry Dehere was there for
the offensive rebound and he drew the foul, the 6th on Sprewell,
sending him to the showers.  From that it was just a song and a dance,
as Lake K. ran out the clock without missing a single free throw in the
last 4 minutes of the game.

KJ was named the Player-of-the-game, who scored 32 points (10-14
FGs) and 12 assists, despite a constant double team.  Lake K. had a
balanced attack, led by Shaq's 22 points in 26 minutes.




LAKE K at MILWAUKEE Round 1 Game 4

Milwaukee came out shooting in this one, looking to build an
early lead to tie the series.  But Lake K. stuck with them, and
neither team led by more than 5 for the first three periods.  At
the end of three, it was 86-84 Lake K.  The fourth period
rolled by just as quickly.  Lake K. was once again applying the
double team to KJ.  Trent was the open man, and during a
stretch run in the four, he hit 5 consecutive open jumpers to
keep Milwaukee in the lead.  With 4 minutes remaining, and
Milwaukee up 1, they went on a 9-0 run, to build a 10 point
lead.  They led 120-110 inside of two minutes, and although
they didn't score in the last two, they win going away.  Lake K.
hit 2 late three's including one as the buzzer sounded, but it
wasn't enough, and the finish wasn't as close as the final score
of 120-116 indicated.

This time, Shaq brought the diesel with him, for the tune of 32
big ones.  But he was only 10-22 from the line, and could only
grab 5 boards, as Milwaukee just owned the boards.  Turnovers
by Milwaukee almost gave this one away, as they committed 11
more TO's than Lake K.  But it was the hot shooting of
Milwaukee, 55% to 45% for Lake K., they gave them the win.
Gary Trent became the unlikely hero, scoring 24 points, with 7
rebounds, in just 25 minutes, to lead all scorers for Milwaukee.

Game #5 is up next, to be played FTF.  Rick, let's get ready to
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUMBLE!



MILWAUKEE at LAKE K Round 1 Game 5

Milwaukee 121  Lake K 114
	A classic battle that saw back and forth action and lead
changes.  Milwaukee enjoyed the early lead despite foul trouble
and led 30-25 after one period.
	Lake K battled back in the second period scoring 43 in
that period surging ahead by five at the break.  Foul trouble
continued for the big men, and offensive fouls were playing a part
of it.
	During the third period, Lake K built a 10 point lead, but
Milwaukee came right back with an 8-0 run and it was a dog fight
again.  Ewing and Shaq went to the benches with four fouls each.
After three, the score was 97-95 Lake K.
	The fourth started close, but Shaq and Ewing each got
their fifth fouls, Ewing first and then Shaq on another offensive
foul.  Whoever fouled out first would make the difference, and it
was Shaq on another offensive foul.  Milwaukee quickly built a
112-102 lead after this and looked to put the game away.  But
Barkley and company weren't ready to go away yet.  Lake K went
on a 10-0 run of their own tying the game at 112-112 late in the
fourth.  However, the run took all their available energy left, and
Milwaukee pulled away in the end winning by seven scoring nine
of the last eleven points.
	Barkley had game highs for points (29) and rebounds
(15) and O'Neal had 17 points and 11 rebounds in limited minutes,
but committed 7 costly turnovers.  With Sprewell on him,
Anderson was held to 5 points.  Meanwhile, KJ and Sprewell
combined for 48 points and 20 assists, and Ewing added 19 points
and 12 rebounds.
	A great series even though I came up on the short end,
and good luck to Milwaukee the rest of the way.

MADISON at DAKOTA Round 1 Game 2

The first quarter started out close until both teams brought subs in and
Dakota's D.Harper scored about 8 points in two minutes. The quarter ended
with a 37-30 lead for Dakota. 

Madison came out in the 2nd quarter, chipped away at the Dakota lead, and
took the lead. Dakota put in their starters at the end of the 2nd and took
the lead. The quarter ended with a 69-58 Dakota lead. Malone had 23 points

DAKOTA at MADISON Round 1 Game 3

A wild game!  Madison ripped out to a 43-21 lead in the 1st
quarter thanks to 5 steals and 77% FG.  Dakota could not get
anything going with a 22% FG.  However, the worm turned
as it always does in the NB of A.  Dakota stormed back with
some opportunisitic defense as they forced Madison to 17
TO's in the 1st half!  The high scores were McDyess with 17
and Malone with 12.  When the dust settled at halftime the
score was Madison 57, Dakota 46.

Things slowed a bit as Dakota steady closed the gap.  Things
kinda of got boring as there were spectular displays of power.
Dakota added 5 more forced TO's and shot better.  At the end
of 3, Madison 85, Dakota 78.  However, that was the calm
before the storm as both teams saved the best for last running
and gunning in the truest fastbreak fashion.  Malone heated up
and was unstoppable, but Mourning also heated up (amazing.)
and kept their distance from the surging Dakota.  Add another
8 TO's to Madison's total, which was 31 at the end of the game.
Good thing they had a 22 point lead in the 1st quarter, since
they needed it.  Only good offense and solid defense (10 blocks,
poor outside shooting) saved Madison.

Some final stats:  Madison 118, Dakota 108
                           Mad FG - 62%  Dak FG - 47%
                           Mad TO - 31  Dak TO - 15



DAKOTA at MADISON Round 1 Game 4

Well the year has come to an end for the MadDogs.  The Dakota
veterans showed the upstart punks how to play the game.  However,
they took their cue and tried to play their game, but werent up for
the challenge.  A high scoring game as Dakota decided to take a
44-28 point advantage in the 1st quarter.  Sounds very familiar to
the last game.  Just like the last game Madison shaved 8 points of
the lead by halftime to make the score 74-66.  However, Dakota
turned it up a notch and by the end of the 3rd quarter the score
was 112-95.  From their any Madison run was met with an equally
matched run of Dakota's own.  This game was another true run and
gun game. (Loyola Marymount?)

Dakota had a balanced attack as the starters had 20 points a piece,
to go with 65% FG to Madison's 57%.  Good point guard matchup
with Kidd getting slight edge in assists, 14 to 12, but Avery had a
much better offensive game.  Equal rebounding and TO's.  Dakota
had the edge on the line with 29-35 to Madison's 18-24.






HARLEM at HAYWARD Round 1 Game 2

Webber had a big first quarter with 11 points and 5 rebounds
  and although both teams each shot over 60% in the first
  quarter Harlem committed too many turnovers and Hayward
  led 40-28 after one quarter.

In the second quarter Michael got hot on penetration shots
  and finished the half with 20 but Webber stayed hot and
  had 21 points and 9 rebounds going into the break.  As
  Hayward kept up its efficient scoring Harlem players were
  in severe foul trouble and Harlem went 4 minutes without
  a point and Hayward led 69-52 at the half.

In the third quarter the two teams played about even and
  Hayward ended the quarter with a 93-79 lead.

With about 9 minutes to go and Hayward up 104-92 Hayward
  went on a 19-7 run to finish the game with a 123-99 win.

Harlem outshot Hayward from the field 53% to 51% but was
  an extremely uncharacteristic 15-27 (56%) from the line as
  Hayward went 33-45 (73%) on free throws.  Harlem committed
  23 turnovers to Hayward's 12 (even though the setting was on
  "neutral court") and Hayward outrebounded Harlem 41-35.
Michael ended up with 39 points on 16-27 shooting but received
  decent support only from Schrempf who was 6-9 from the field
  with 8 rebounds and 6 assists.  Bradley was only 3-10 with 3
  rebounds in 25 foul-plagued minutes.
Webber finished with 25 points and 13 rebounds on 11-18
  shooting while Penny had a strong fourth quarter ending up
  with 31 points.  Sabonis chipped in with 10-14 field goals
  and Wesley had 19 points and 12 assists.



HAYWARD at HARLEM Round 1 Game 3

With the season on the line the Knights took the floor and came
  out ready to play in the first half.&nbsp; The 2nd half, well that
  was another story.&nbsp; 109-97, the defending champs move on to
  the semifinal round.&nbsp; Penny Hardaway had 41, 24 in the 2nd half
  as he started the 3rd quarter with back to back 3's and hit
  every crucial shot in 2nd half when it was needed to stop Knight
  runs trying to get back into this game.

Detlef had 22 and Jordan and Steve Kerr both had 17.&nbsp; The game
  slipped away in the 3rd quarter as the Warriors smelled the
  blood and hammered the door shut on the Knights season in the
  4th quarter.&nbsp; Score was 56-47 at the half but a 36-23 edge in
  the 3rd gave Hayward a 83-79 lead at the end of the 3rd quarter.
&nbsp; Webber had 20 and 11 rebounds while E. Johnson had 6 points, 14
  rebounds and 8 blocked shots, 12 as a team for Hayward.
