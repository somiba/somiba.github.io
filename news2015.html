<p>12/23/2015 Q1 Deadline<br>
Anchorage sent his Q1 home games a few hours after the deadline, but
they were accepted before Jeff informed me in advance.<br>
tulana01 reaana06 nazana09 tulana10 linana17 davana20 were autoplayed.

<p>12/7/2015 Inadvertent Jerebko overusage<br>
Sunnyvale had 2 road games at Reading in the first quarter, on days 7
and 20.  The game plans were identical except for Jonas Jerebko
sitting out the second game.  Donald accidentally used the first
gameplan for both games (won by SUN).  The EC ruled 3-0 (Brian, Laird,
and Rick voting) to increase Jonas Jerebko's games allowed for the
season from 75 to 76.
</p>

<p>11/25/2015 Anchorage overusage<br>
In rucanc07 won by RUC, C.J. McCollum and Spencer Hawes saw time
although they were scheduled to miss that game.   The EC voted (4-0)
Laird, Charles, Rick, and Brian to have them miss the next game the
two teams play at ANC, which is on day 20.
